            We've built up the tools we need to draw glyphs, the foundational
            building blocks of our graphics. However, there are a few more
            elements we need to add in order to build data visualizations. We
            start the next leg of our journey by looking at how we can draw text
            which will be useful for axes, titles, direct labeling, and more!
            This is the first element of Skills Lab 4 which focuses on how to
            bring in external resources to aid our drawing code. In this case,
            we will bring in outside fonts.

                <h2>Font</h2>

                Before we can draw text, we need a font. Your machine has a
                number of fonts pre-installed that you can use. Maybe you've
                installed some of your own! All that said, different machines
                may have different default fonts so it is often wise to keep a
                copy of the fonts with a visualization. This is especially
                important for interactive visualizations you are sending to
                others. That in mind, some terminology that you might encounter
                when working with fonts:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A type has different typefaces like bold or italic. We
                        will be working with "regular" for this tutorial.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A type is a collection of related fonts. For example,
                        each typeface would be a font within the type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each letter in a font is a glyph and each shape within
                        is typically called a stroke.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some fonts have serifs which are small lines at the end
                        of characters. Fonts without serifs are called
                        sans-serif fonts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The font can be set to a different size. This size can
                        be specified using a few different units but we will use
                        pixels which is often just called px.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Font glyphs have ascendors and descenders which are
                        parts of the letter that extend outside the body of the
                        character. For example, a descender can be the bottom
                        part of a "g" character.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The width of each character or space is often not the
                        same. This is called a "variable-width" font. However,
                        for showing code, it is common to use a "fixed-width" or
                        "monospace" font which ensures that any two lines of
                        text with the same number of characters and spaces is
                        the same visual length.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We will use an open variable-width sans-serif type called
                <a href="https://github.com/uswds/public-sans">Public Sans</a>
                which is under the
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/uswds/public-sans/blob/develop/LICENSE.md"
                    >SIL Open Font License</a
                >. These fonts come in different file formats but we will
                generally work with Open Type Format or OTF.
            </section>

            <section id="text">
                <h2>Text</h2>
                Go ahead and
                <a href="/PublicSans-Regular.otf"
                    >download Public Sans' regular font in OTF format</a
                >
                and add it to your
                <a href="https://editor.sketchingpy.org/">sketchbook</a> by
                clicking on upload file. Next, let's draw a first piece of 14 px
                sized text.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)
sketch.clear("#FFFFFF")

sketch.set_text_font("PublicSans-Regular", 14)
sketch.set_fill("#333333")
sketch.clear_stroke()
sketch.draw_text(10, 240, "Interactive Data Science and Visualization")

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                If you are using Sketchingpy outside the browser, you may need
                to say "PublicSans-Regular.otf" instead. Anyway, try switching
                the text to say "Stat 198" and change the font size.

                <details>
                    <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
                    <p>
                        First, make sure that the filename is
                        PublicSans-Regular.otf as the font name must match what
                        you write in your code. Second, if the font still isn't
                        displaying, there was a bug fix recently. Try going to
                        the sketchbook and refreshing twice. Specifically, try
                        doing a hard refresh through ctrl + shift + r or cmd +
                        shift + r depending on your operating system.
                    </p>
                </details>
            </section>

            <section id="horizontal-align">
                <h2>Horizontal Align</h2>
                Like other types of drawing, we can specify alignment for text.
                We will start with horizontal alignment as it is a bit simplier.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)
sketch.clear("#FFFFFF")

sketch.set_text_font("PublicSans-Regular", 14)
sketch.set_fill("#333333")
sketch.clear_stroke()

sketch.set_text_align('left')
sketch.draw_text(10, 150, 'Interactive Data Science and Visualization')

sketch.set_text_align('right')
sketch.draw_text(490, 350, 'Interactive Data Science and Visualization')

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                There is another option for horizontal alignment called "center"
                which draws the text such that its geometric center is at the x
                position specified. Try changing the text above to use center
                instead.
            </section>

            <section id="vertical-align">
                <h2>Vertical Align</h2>
                Vertical alignment has a few options: top, bottom, center, and
                baseline. To see what the each does, let's play with some text
                which as descenders.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)
sketch.clear("#FFFFFF")

sketch.set_stroke("#333333")
sketch.draw_line(10, 250, 490, 250)

sketch.set_text_font("PublicSans-Regular", 14)
sketch.set_fill("#333333")
sketch.clear_stroke()

sketch.set_text_align('left', 'top')
sketch.draw_text(10, 250, 'Going on a journey.')

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try changing top to bottom, center, and baseline to see how the
                alignment changes. In particular, compare bottom to baseline:
                the descenders fall below the y position in baseline but the
                text moves up such that the descenders end at the y position in
                bottom.

                There's a lot to say about type that we won't get to in this
                course. However, if you want to learn more, I strongly recommend
