            In our
            <a href="/labs/features_form.html">previous tutorial</a>
            which explored form as a preattentive feature, we investigated
            drawing different shapes. In this tutorial, we continue Skills Lab 3
            by looking at our next preattentive features: color. Indeed, color
            is one part of a broader set of glyph attributes often referred to
            simply as style. This suite of options can help as important
            encoding device and, when used together with other preattentive
            features, can help increase data density.

                <h2>Hex Codes</h2>
                Our glyphs can actually have multiple potential colors at the
                same time. However, the first step is finding the color we want.
                We discussed some options in class:
                <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank"
                    >ColorBrewer</a
                >
                and
                <a href="https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/" target="_blank"
                    >I Want Hue</a
                >
                both provide good options. If you have Python installed on your
                machine, you might also take a look at
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm?tab=readme-ov-file"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Viscm</a
                >. Finally, if you just need to manipulate some colors, a great
                tool is
                <a href="https://hslpicker.com/#ffd900" target="_blank"
                    >HSL Color Picker</a
                >, which can work on multiple color spaces at the same time. All
                that said, many (maybe most) tools will work with hex codes or
                offer hex codes as an option. I'll be using those color codes
                below but you can see what they correspond to (and change them)
                using HSL Color Picker. Indeed, many of these colors will come
                from ColorBrewer. On that note, be sure to check out a short

            <section id="fill">
                <h2>Fill</h2>
                The easiest place to start for styling in
                <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/" target="_blank"
                    >Sketchingpy</a
                >
                is the fill color for a shape. Let's use circles to demonstrate!
                Here, we can draw circles with different colors as well one
                circle which has no fill (will pass through to any figures drawn
                behind):

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_fill("#a6cee3")
sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a")
sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try using some of our color tools to specify a different fill
                color!
            </section>

            <section id="transparency">
                <h2>Transparency</h2>
                With our circles overlapping, we notice that what is drawn first
                goes at the bottom and is obsurced by whatever is drawn
                afterwards. This is called the
                <a
                    href="https://bcalabs.org/subject/painter-algorithm-in-computer-graphics"
                    >Painter's Algorithm</a
                >
                which basically says you should draw your scene from back to
                front. Let's let the user peer through those overlapping shapes
                though by adding transparency to our color. Appending two
                additional numbers to our hex codes specifies opacity where 00
                means fully transparent and FF means fully opaque.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_fill("#a6cee399")
sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a99")
sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try changing the order in which the colors are set and the
                opacity part of the color code.
            </section>

            <section id="stroke">
                <h2>Stroke</h2>
                So far, we've been manipulating the insides of our circles.
                Let's change the outsides. Same thing as before, let's have one
                circle that's different.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_stroke("#1f78b4")
sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_fill("#C0C0C0")
sketch.clear_stroke()
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_stroke("#33a02c")
sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try changing the colors again. When the area is smaller, is the
                contrast needed for readability higher?
            </section>

            <section id="weight">
                <h2>Weight</h2>
                Let's continue that thought around the size of these areas. We
                change the stroke width through its weight:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_stroke_weight(3)

sketch.set_stroke("#1f78b4")
sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_fill("#C0C0C0")
sketch.clear_stroke()
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.set_stroke("#33a02c")
sketch.clear_fill()
sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try changing the strokes such that the first and last circle
                have different weights.
            </section>

            <section id="context">
                <h2>Context</h2>
                Before we move on to the transformation matrix, we have a chance
                to play with some of the concepts around relative color
                interpretation and figure / ground as discussed in lectures. Try
                this sketch out for a moment which uses colors which could be
                useful for a quantitative scale:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.clear('#FFFFFF')

sketch.set_ellipse_mode("radius")

def draw_circles(y):
    sketch.set_stroke("#000000")

    sketch.set_fill("#edf8fb")
    sketch.draw_ellipse(150, y, 20, 20)

    sketch.set_fill("#b2e2e2")
    sketch.draw_ellipse(200, y, 20, 20)

    sketch.set_fill("#66c2a4")
    sketch.draw_ellipse(250, y, 20, 20)

    sketch.set_fill("#2ca25f")
    sketch.draw_ellipse(300, y, 20, 20)

    sketch.set_fill("#006d2c")
    sketch.draw_ellipse(350, y, 20, 20)

draw_circles(125)

sketch.set_rect_mode("corner")
sketch.clear_stroke()
sketch.set_fill("#555555")
sketch.draw_rect(0, 250, 500, 250)

draw_circles(375)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Note that this uses
                <a
                    href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/clear.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >clear</a
                >. Let's assume for a moment that this is a
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/heatmap.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >heatmap</a
                >. We don't have a color scale listed. However, based on the
                background, which dot do you think corresponds to the highest
                and lowest number? Does your answer change depending on the
                background? It is possible that, using the concept of figure /
                ground from lecture, you may think the color with the highest
                luminance contrast corresponds to the highest number. That is a
                common recommendation! In other words, the rightmost dot may be
                seen as the highest in the top part of the graphic and the
                leftmost dot may be seen as the highest in the bottom part of
                the graphic.
