            In our <a href="/labs/features_form.html">previous tutorial</a> which explored form as a preattentive feature, we investigated drawing different shapes. In this tutorial, we continue Skills Lab 3 by looking at our next preattentive features color. Indeed, color is one part of a broader set of glyph attributes often referred to simply as style. This suite of options can help as important encoding device and, when used together with other preattentive features, can help increase data density.

                <h2>Hex Codes</h2>
                Our glyphs can actually have multiple potential colors at the same time. However, the first step is finding the color we want. We discussed some options in class: <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank"
    >ColorBrewer</a
> and <a href="https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/" target="_blank"
    >I Want Hue</a
> both provide good options. If you have Python installed on your machine, you might also take a look at <a
    href="https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm?tab=readme-ov-file"
    target="_blank"
    >Viscm</a
>. Finally, if you just need to manipulate some colors, a great tool is <a href="https://hslpicker.com/#ffd900" target="_blank"
    >HSL Color Picker</a
>, which can work on multiple color spaces at the same time.

            <section id="fill">
                <h2>Fill</h2>
                The easiest place to start for styling in <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/" target="_blank"
    >Sketchingpy</a
> is the fill color for a shape. Let's use circles to demonstrate!
<pre> import sketchingpy
sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)
sketch.set_fill("#a6cee3") sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)
sketch.clear_fill() sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)
sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a") sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)
sketch.show()</pre >

            <section id="transparency">
                <h2>Transparency</h2>
                With our circles overlapping, we notice that what is drawn first goes at the bottom. We can control transparency to create layered effects. Learn more about transparency and the alpha channel.

            <section id="stroke">
                <h2>Stroke</h2>
                In addition to fill, shapes can have a stroke or outline. Learn how to control stroke colors and create shapes with just outlines.

            <section id="weight">
                <h2>Weight</h2>
                The thickness of strokes can be controlled with weight settings. This is useful for emphasis and visual hierarchy.

            <section id="context">
                <h2>Context</h2>
                Color choices should consider context, accessibility, and cultural meanings. Learn about best practices for using color in visualization.

                Continue on to <a href="/labs/features_position.html">Tutorial 6</a> to learn about position as a preattentive feature.
