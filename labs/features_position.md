## Introduction

Position is arguably the most effective preattentive feature for encoding quantitative data. Learn how to use position effectively in your visualizations.


## Coordinates

Learn about coordinate systems and how to position elements precisely in your visualizations.


## Scatterplots

Scatterplots use position along two axes to encode two variables. Practice creating scatterplots with Sketchingpy.


## Next

Continue on to Tutorial 7 to learn about orientation as a preattentive feature.
