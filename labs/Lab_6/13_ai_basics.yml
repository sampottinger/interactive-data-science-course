  In this optional tutorial, we will explore how to use AI assistants to
  help create data visualizations. Specifically, we can collaborate with AI
  or "large language models" (LLMs) to build visualizations more quickly.
  However, we will do so while still applying the design knowledge and
  multi-disciplinary lenses we've developed together throughout the course.

    short: Motivation
    long: Why use AI for data visualization
    markdown: |
      So far, we have been building data visualizations through a combination
      of pre-built charting libraries (like through matplotlib) and custom
      drawing with technologies like Sketchingpy. However, sometimes it can be
      a lot of code. Iteration times between one idea to the next can be
      extensive. What if we could get through those cycles faster? Maybe we
      could explore more design possibilities!

      That in mind, we next introduce AI assistants which can help you
      implement faster. That said, these tools are best when used to
      accelerate that iteration process we've already seen in the class. In
      other words, as we will see in a moment, there is still value that
      comes from building a prototype and experiencing it (as a human) to
      further improve design choices.

      Let's try practicing going through this cycle by revisiting the moose
      and wolves example from the very start of class. However, this time,
      let's see what it feels like to be accelerated by AI while still
      applying our critical design perspective.

      AI assistants like [Claude](https://claude.ai/),
      [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), or other language models can help
      generate visualization code quickly. However, they don't necessarily know
      about design and can't experience visualizations the same way you (and
      your human audiences) will. A lot of the heavy lifting still comes from
      guiding solutions to a good conclusion, taking advantage of the
      techniques we discussed in class. Put another way, they work best when
      you bring your visualization expertise to direct the conversation which
      involves:

      - Knowing what kinds of visualization will best serve your data and
        purpose or what you might want to explore.
      - Recognizing when a visualization generated has issues with
        readability, accessibility, or other design considerations like poor
        gestalt.
      - Providing specific feedback to guide the output in the process of
        iterating towards a better result.

      All that in mind, think of an AI assistant as an avenue to accelerate
      implementation quickly but ask if that moving faster is always better.
      How could it be an issue? Well, this depends on the task at hand but
      consider that, when writing code yourself, you are confronted in the
      implementation process with lots of questions and decisions because
      the code forces you to be explicit about what you want. Instead, when
      AI helps you move quickly, some of those choices might be made for you
      possibly without you realizing. In other words, you need to be even
      more conscientious of all of the concepts from the class in order to
      ensure your ideas are layered in. Be careful that AI doesn't leave you
      with less control.

    long: Setting up for AI-assisted visualization
    markdown: |
      We'll be using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to create a
      visualization of predator-prey dynamics between wolves and moose
      populations at Isle Royale National Park, returning to an example from
      [Lesson 1](/lesson1.html). This gives us a nice dataset which has some
      dimensionality but still tame enough that we can take advantage of some
      pre-built charts. The goal here is to create a split bar plot showing
      both wolf and moose populations over time, with wolves extending to the
      left and moose extending to the right.

      Before we can get into it, we do need access to an AI assistant that
      can generate Python for data visualization. I used Claude which
      typically offers strong performance in testing but other options
      include [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com),
      [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), and
      [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/). If in need of a free option, Mistral
      has also performed quite well.

      Next, as in [Tutorial 1](/labs/python_intro.html), you'll also need a
      Python environment where you can run the generated code. However, this
      could be [Jupyter Lite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) which does
      not require installation. That said, if you used something other than
      Jupyter Lite, make sure you have matplotlib installed in your
      environment. For example, this could be done with (optionally in a
      [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)):

      ```
      pip install matplotlib
      ```

      Once you're set up, open your AI assistant in one window and your
      Python environment in another so you can easily execute the code as
      you go. This set up can help fuel that essential iteration process.

      **Note**: The exact output you get from an AI assistant may differ
      slightly from what's shown here. That's completely normal and expected!
      The key learning objective here is to experience the process of
      iteration: making a request, reviewing the output, identifying what to
      improve, and refining your prompts accordingly.
  - name: initial-request
    short: Initial Request
    long: Making the first request to the AI assistant
    html: >
      <p>
        Let's start by making our first request to the assistant, just to get
        a basic initial plot. Try copying this prompt into your chat window
        with your chosen AI:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="prompt">Hello! Can you please use matplotlib to generate a graph of wolves vs moose populations as a split bar plot (one going to the left and the other going to the right) where the axes have different colors to correspond to the bar colors for the two series? Please have the left facing axis for wolves go from 0 to 50 and the right facing axis for moose go from 0 to 2500. See https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/wolf-moose-populations.htm for data.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the code provided by the AI
        assistant. You should see a visualization with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Blue bars extending to the left representing wolf populations
        </li>
        <li>
          Orange (or similar color) bars extending to the right representing
          moose populations
        </li>
        <li>
          A timeline showing years (likely 1980-2019 or similar range)
        </li>
        <li>
          Color-coordinated axes with scales from 0-50 for wolves and 0-2500
          for moose
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Take a moment to examine the output. What do you notice? Can you see
        the predator-prey relationship in the data? The classic predator-prey
        oscillation pattern might be visible. However, it's likely that the
        wolf data appear compressed because AI made a symmetric scale: the
        range of the actual data on one side is much smaller (up to 50) than
        the other (up to 2500). This brings us to our first iteration.
      </p>
  - name: first-iteration
    short: First Iteration
    long: Improving the visualization through iteration
    html: >
      <p>
        Let's address this issue where the wolf population changes may be hard
        to see because they're compressed into a narrow space compared to the
        moose. Specifically, let's improve this by giving wolves more
        horizontal space per individual. This will make the harmonic
        relationship between the two populations easier to see. How about
        another prompt:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="prompt">This is great but the wolves are too compressed. Let's have the split at roughly half way across the plot. This means that there is more horizontal space per wolf than per moose. However, this will show the harmonic relationship better.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the updated code. Now you should
        see:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Wolves taking up approximately half the plot width (left side)
        </li>
        <li>
          Moose taking up approximately half the plot width (right side)
        </li>
        <li>
          Much more visible oscillations in the wolf population
        </li>
        <li>
          The predator-prey relationship should be much clearer
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By allocating equal horizontal space to both scales, we've effectively
        "zoomed in" on the wolf data. Now you can see how when wolves are
        high, moose populations tend to be lower. Conversely, when wolves go
        down (especially around 2015-2018 in the data), moose populations go
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an great example of how your human understanding of a
        visualization helps guide the AI. This is especially true as the story
        (or capabilities for users to tell their own stories) becomes more
        clear through experience.
      </p>
  - name: refining-labels
    short: Refining Labels
    long: Improving readability through label refinement
    html: >
      <p>
        The visualization is getting clearer but you may also notice that the
        axis labels might need some work. For instance, there might be
        overlapping text where the colored "Wolves" and "Moose" labels compete
        with a black axis title. If that is the case, let's clean this up and
        make the supporting elements more clear. Try this prompt:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="prompt">Perfect! We have the colored wolves and moose labels overlapping with the black axis title. Let's set the black axis title to empty and then let's make the colors for both series darker so that it is easy to read wolves and moose. Finally, let's say "Number of Wolves" and "Number of Moose" in that colored text.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the code and verify:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The black axis title is now gone, eliminating the overlap
        </li>
        <li>
          The blue and orange colors are darker and hopefully easier to read
        </li>
        <li>
          The labels now should say "Number of Wolves" and "Number of Moose"
          instead of just "Wolves" and "Moose"
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Notice how this iteration focused on reducing visual clutter and
        improving readability. This connects to Tufte's concepts of reducing
        chartjunk and maximizing the data-ink ratio!
      </p>
  - name: final-polish
    short: Final Polish
    long: Adding final touches for clarity
    html: >
      <p>
        There's one more improvement we can make. Right now, it's possible
        that the numerical labels along the horizontal axis (the tick marks
        showing the actual population numbers) are all in black. Let's make
        them match their respective data series for maximum clarity. Try this
        final prompt:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="prompt">Doing really well! One last thing. The labels for the count (along the bottom horizontal axis). Can you please make those the same color as the series they describe (so one color on left and a different color on right)?</blockquote>

      <p>
        <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the final version. You should now
        see:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Blue tick labels on the left side (for wolf counts)
        </li>
        <li>
          Orange tick labels on the right side (for moose counts)
        </li>
        <li>
          The tick marks themselves are also color-coded
        </li>
        <li>
          The entire visualization now uses color consistently to distinguish
          the two data series
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Alright... after all of that valuable back and forth, you hopefully
        now have a polished visualization that clearly shows the predator-prey
        dynamics between wolves and moose. Just as if you built it up from
        scratch by hand, we can see how iteration with AI can eventually
        achieve a similar result where every visual element is intentionally
        designed to support the viewer's understanding of the data.

    long: Reflecting on the AI-assisted process
    markdown: |
      Let's step back and think about what we just accomplished and what it
      might tell us about working with AI assistants for data visualization.
      Specifically, notice that we (likely) didn't get a perfect visualization
      in the first try. Instead, we went through several rounds as we
      determined the elements about which we needed to be more precise:

      - Initial request with basic requirements
      - Adjusting the spatial allocation to better show the data
      - Cleaning up labels and improving readability
      - Fine-tuning color coding for consistency

      Think back to your regular iterative process when you write code "by
      hand" and how this might be similar to how it is often best to work
      with AI assistants. Importantly, at each step, we have an opportunity
      to incorporate knowledge from this course and from our experience of a
      prototype. Just as we created early sketches in code and refine for
      higher fidelity in prior tutorials, we can continue to use the lenses
      of the class in a cycle of critically evaluating ever improving
      outputs through ever more specific prompts.

      This is a first stab at a relatively simple script. However, what
      happens when things get longer or more involved? What if we have a chart
      type for which there isn't already a pre-built implementation? Let's
      continue onwards to [Tutorial 14](/labs/ai_advanced.html) to learn
      about advanced AI techniques including llms.txt and subagents /
      agentic workflows.
