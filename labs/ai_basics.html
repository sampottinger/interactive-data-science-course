            <h1>AI Basics for Data Visualization</h1>

            In this optional tutorial, we will explore how to use AI assistants to help create data visualizations. Rather than writing every line of code from scratch, we can collaborate with AI to build visualizations more quickly while still applying the design knowledge and multi-disciplinary lenses we've developed together throughout the course.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                So far, you have been building data visualizations through a combination of pre-built charting libraries and custom drawing with Sketchingpy. Next, we introduce AI assistants which can help you build your ideas faster. Indeed, these tools are best when used to accelerate the iteration that comes from building a prototype and experiencing it to further improve design choices.
            </section>

            <section id="role">
                <h2>Role of AI</h2>

                <p>
                    AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or other language models can help generate visualization code quickly. However, they don't necessarily know about design and can't experience visualizations the same way you (and your human audiences) will. A lot of the heavy lifting still comes from guiding solutions to a good conclusion, taking advantage of the techniques we discussed in class. Put another way, they work best when you bring your visualization expertise to direct the conversation which involves:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Knowing what kinds of visualization will best serve your data and purpose or what you might want to explore.</li>
                    <li>Recognizing when a visualization generated has issues with readability, accessibility, or other design considerations.</li>
                    <li>Providing specific feedback to improve the output in the process of iterating towards a better result.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    All that in mind, think of an AI assistant as an avenue to accelerate implementation quickly but note that moving faster isn't always better. How could that be the case? Consider that, when writing code yourself, you are confronted in the implementation process with lots of questions and decisions because the code forces you to be explicit about what you want. Instead, when AI helps you move quickly, you need to be even more conscientious of all of the concepts from the class in order to ensure your ideas are layered because it is possible that, through the help of an AI, you actually aren't making all of the initial choices yourself. This may leave you with less control!
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="prepare">
                <h2>Prepare</h2>

                <p>
                    We'll be using matplotlib to create a visualization of predator-prey dynamics between wolves and moose populations at Isle Royale National Park. You don't need to download the data yourself. We'll ask the AI assistant to fetch it for us! The goal here is to create a split bar plot showing both wolf and moose populations over time, with wolves extending to the left and moose extending to the right. Anyway, with this goal established, we will need some things ready to go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, you'll need access to an AI assistant that can generate Python code for data visualization. I used Claude in helping build out this lab but some options include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Next, as in <a href="/labs/python_intro.html">Tutorial 1</a>, you'll also need a Python environment where you can run the generated code. However, this could be <a href="https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/">Jupyter Lite</a> which does not require installation. However, if you used something other than Jupyter Lite, make sure you have matplotlib installed in your environment. For example, this could be done with:
                </p>

                <pre>
pip install matplotlib
</pre>

                <p>
                    Once you're set up, open your AI assistant in one window and your Python environment in another so you can easily execute the code as you go, helping fuel that essential iteration process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note</strong>: The exact output you get from an AI assistant may differ slightly from what's shown here. That's completely normal and expected. The key learning goal is to experience the process of iteration: making a request, reviewing the output, identifying what to improve, and refining your prompts accordingly.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="initial-request">
                <h2>Initial Request</h2>

                Let's start by making our first request to the AI assistant.

                <p>
                    Try copying this prompt into your AI assistant:
                </p>

                <pre>
Hello! Can you please use matplotlib to generate a graph of wolves vs moose
populations as a split bar plot (one going to the left and the other going
to the right) where the axes have different colors to correspond to the bar
colors for the two series? Please have the left facing axis for wolves go
from 0 to 50 and the right facing axis for moose go from 0 to 2500. See
https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/wolf-moose-populations.htm for data.
</pre>

                <p>
                    <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the code provided by the AI assistant. You should see a visualization with:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Blue bars extending to the left representing wolf populations</li>
                    <li>Orange (or similar color) bars extending to the right representing moose populations</li>
                    <li>A timeline showing years (likely 1980-2019 or similar range)</li>
                    <li>Color-coordinated axes with scales from 0-50 for wolves and 0-2500 for moose</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Take a moment to examine the output. What do you notice? Can you see the predator-prey relationship in the data? The classic predator-prey oscillation pattern should be visible, but the wolf data might appear compressed because the scale is much smaller (0-50) compared to moose (0-2500). This brings us to our first iteration.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="first-iteration">
                <h2>First Iteration</h2>

                <p>
                    Looking at the initial visualization, you might notice that the wolf population changes are hard to see because they're compressed into a narrow space compared to the moose. The wolves vary from about 0 to 50, while moose vary from about 500 to 2500. The wolf variations are too compact to read properly! Let's improve this by giving wolves more horizontal space. This will make the harmonic relationship between the two populations easier to see. How about another prompt:
                </p>

                <pre>
This is great but the wolves are too compressed. Let's have the split at
roughly half way across the plot. This means that there is more horizontal
space per wolf than per moose. However, this will show the harmonic
relationship better.
</pre>

                <p>
                    <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the updated code. Now you should see:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wolves taking up approximately half the plot width (left side)</li>
                    <li>Moose taking up approximately half the plot width (right side)</li>
                    <li>Much more visible oscillations in the wolf population</li>
                    <li>The predator-prey relationship should be much clearer</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    By allocating equal horizontal space to both scales, we've effectively "zoomed in" on the wolf data. Now you can see how when wolves are high, moose populations tend to be lower, and when wolves crash (especially around 2015-2018 in the data), moose populations surge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is an excellent example of how your visualization knowledge guides the AI. Hopefully the assistant gave you a chart meeting your initial expectations. However, perhaps that initial prompt didn't include our knowledge of what the optimal visual encoding would be for the relationship we want to highlight.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="refining-labels">
                <h2>Refining Labels</h2>

                <p>
                    The visualization is getting better, but you may notice that the axis labels could be clearer. Specifically, there might be overlapping text where the colored "Wolves" and "Moose" labels compete with a black axis title. If that is the case, let's clean this up and make the labels more descriptive. Try this prompt:
                </p>

                <pre>
Perfect! We have the colored wolves and moose labels overlapping with the
black axis title. Let's set the black axis title to empty and then let's
make the colors for both series darker so that it is easy to read wolves
and moose. Finally, let's say "Number of Wolves" and "Number of Moose" in
that colored text.
</pre>

                <p>
                    <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the code and verify:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The black axis title is now gone, eliminating the overlap</li>
                    <li>The blue and orange colors are darker and easier to read</li>
                    <li>The labels now say "Number of Wolves" and "Number of Moose" instead of just "Wolves" and "Moose"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Notice how this iteration focused on reducing visual clutter and improving readability. This connects to Tufte's concepts of reducing chartjunk and maximizing the data-ink ratio.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="final-polish">
                <h2>Final Polish</h2>

                <p>
                    There's one more improvement we can make. Right now, it's likely that the numerical labels along the horizontal axis (the tick marks showing the actual population numbers) are all in black. Let's make them match their respective data series for maximum clarity. Try this final prompt:
                </p>

                <pre>
Doing really well. One last thing. The labels for the count (along the
bottom horizontal axis). Can you please make those the same color as the
series they describe (so one color on left and a different color on right)?
</pre>

                <p>
                    <strong>Check the work</strong>: Run the final version. You should now see:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Blue tick labels on the left side (for wolf counts)</li>
                    <li>Orange tick labels on the right side (for moose counts)</li>
                    <li>The tick marks themselves are also color-coded</li>
                    <li>The entire visualization now uses color consistently to distinguish the two data series</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Alright... after all of that valuable back and forth, you hopefully now have a polished visualization that clearly shows the predator-prey dynamics between wolves and moose. Every visual element is intentionally designed to support the viewer's understanding of the data.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    Let's step back and think about what we just accomplished and what it teaches us about working with AI assistants for data visualization. Specifically, notice that we (likely) didn't get a perfect visualization in one shot. We went through several rounds as we determined the elements about which we needed to be more explicit:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Initial request with basic requirements</li>
                    <li>Adjusting the spatial allocation to better show the data</li>
                    <li>Cleaning up labels and improving readability</li>
                    <li>Fine-tuning color coding for consistency</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    This shows that your regular iterative process when you write code "by hand" is similar to how it is often best to work with AI assistants. Importantly, at each step, we have an opportunity to incorporate knowledge from this course. Just as we created early sketches in code and refine for higher fidelity in prior tutorials, continue to use the lenses of the class to critically evaluate ever improving outputs through ever more specific prompts.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="next">
                <h2>Next</h2>

                That's the start of AI. However, this code snippet was pretty small and it was using a pre-built chart from matplotlib. What might using AI look like when we take advantage of Sketchingpy?
