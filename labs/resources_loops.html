            <h1>User Loops</h1>
            We will next dip our toes back into interactivity through the
            concept of user loops. This is an essential idea that originally
            comes from game design that we can apply in order to structure our
            users' interactions with our pieces. Note that there aren't any new
            code constructs in this tutorial. Instead, we will look at
            structural concepts in some code snippets I have for you to read
            which demonstrate some common patterns used for interactivity. You
            should recognize some pieces from earlier!

            <section id="about-loops">
                <h2>About Loops</h2>
                To build up these ideas, we will create a simulation which
                involves spinning three wheels of color to combine red, green,
                and blue together. We will use the concept of gameplay loops
                from video game design to create a three loop structure:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We start with the idea that there some repeated action a
                        user is doing moment to moment. This is called the core
                        loop. Our core loop will be spinning a wheel to get to a
                        desired color within that wheel (certain amount of red,
                        for example).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, the core loop can be placed within larger
                        loops. For example, while our core loop is changing one
                        individual color component (how much red, green, blue),
                        our "secondary loop" is trying to achieve a specific
                        combined color across all three color components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, our "tertiary loop" may be comparing different
                        colors: the current color selected against the memory of
                        past colors.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Note that the loops sometimes exist as explicit pieces of the
                code: specific functions supporting one loop or the other.
                However, sometimes the loops emerge from the user's experience
                of a piece.

                <h2>Simulation</h2>
                With that outline in mind, let's go ahead and build this
                simulation without interactivity first. Try to read my

                try changing the radius.

            <section id="loops">
                <h2>Loops</h2>
                Next, let's add in the interactivity! Take a look at my
                <a
                    href="https://gist.github.com/sampottinger/34d0b9bd0200abae03408587974deff3"

                    >second interactive version of this code</a
                >. After reading it, give it a run. Try making the lightest and
                darkest color you can. Can you feel the different loops? How
                does the experience feel if you change the rotation speed?
            </section>
            <section id="terminology">
                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                Finally, a quick note about terminology. Some game designers
                would say that:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are three loops: a core, secondary, and tertiary
                        loop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is one "verb" or one "action" which is "hover"
                        using the mouse.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Indeed, those designers would say there is only one verb by
                which the user can interact with the simulation even if they can
                use that action in diffrent contexts (different wheels) which
                make it feel like three verbs.

                We've brought the idea of the user back into our sketches. Let's
