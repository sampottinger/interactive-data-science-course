  While loading external images likely won't be a common tactic for
  visualizations in this course, I still want to briefly explore how to use
  them. We will also mention buffers which are a kind of image that you
  build from within your sketch which can help "copy and paste" a part of
  your drawing in repetition. These can sometimes provide a performance
  boost if you have a complex graphic! Finally, we will look at how we can
  save images from our sketches.

  - name: load-images
    short: Load Images
    long: Load and display external images
    body: >
      Let's load a simple image and draw it. Go ahead and add
      <a href="/labs/reading.png" target="_blank">reading.png</a> to your
      sketchbook. Then, add the following code:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2DWeb(500, 500)
      sketch.clear('#707070')

      image = sketch.get_image('reading.png')
      image.resize(150, 150)
      sketch.set_image_mode('corner')
      sketch.draw_image(250, 250, image)

      sketch.show()</pre>

      After giving this a run, try changing the resize dimensions. Finally,
      try changing the mode specified in set_image_mode. There are two
      options: center and corner.
  - name: transparency
    short: Transparency
    long: Working with image transparency
    body: >
      Some file formats like png can support transparency. Others always
      have a filled background. To demonstrate how transparency works, try
      this interactive sketch.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2DWeb(500, 500)

      image = sketch.get_image('reading.png')
      image.resize(150, 150)

      def draw(sketch):
          sketch.clear('#707070')

          mouse = sketch.get_mouse()

          sketch.clear_stroke()
          sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
          sketch.set_fill('#A6CEE350')
          sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

          sketch.set_image_mode('center')
          sketch.draw_image(mouse.get_pointer_x(), mouse.get_pointer_y(),
          image)

      sketch.on_step(draw)

      sketch.show()</pre>

      Try changing reading.png to
      <a href="/labs/reading.jpg" target="_blank">reading.jpg</a> instead.
      While PNG has a transparency layer, JPEG doesn't support transparency.
  - name: buffers
    short: Buffers
    long: Understanding graphics buffers for performance
    body: >
      <p>
        We won't go too far into buffers but, if you have an "expensive"
        part of your graphic to draw, it might make sense to save a copy of
        your work instead of having it recreated from scrach on each step.
        Buffers are like images that aren't saved to files but, instead, are
        held on to by the computer in memory for quick re-drawing. For more
        details, see the
        <a
          href="https://sketchingpy.org/examples/web/example.html?sketch=buffer_simple"
          target="_blank">buffers example</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        All that said, to motivate why you might take this approach, imagine
        your are drawing the user's location on a map. Let's say that the
        map is made up of thousands of points and lines. It can be expensive
        to draw that each time by calling draw_line. Instead, you might save
        the results of your work after drawing it once, writing to one of
        these in-memory images and just drawing glyphs on top of that map
        like, for example, to indicate where the user currently within that
        space.

  - name: save-images
    short: Save Images
    long: Export images from your sketches
    body: >
      All this in mind, perhaps most important for us is saving from our
      sketches. Let's make a simple image file with an ellipse.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)
      sketch.save_image('ellipse.png')
      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      By default, this will have a transparent background (for most
      platforms). Note that, if you don't want a transparent background, you
      can specify a background color by calling
      <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/clear.html"
      target="_blank">clear</a>.

      I think we have everything we need to make drawings. Let's next take a
      brief look at interactivity. Continue on to
      <a href="/labs/resources_loops.html">Tutorial 10</a> to learn about
      user loops.
