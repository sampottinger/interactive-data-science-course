  We will next dip our toes back into interactivity through the
  concept of user loops. This is an essential idea that originally
  comes from game design that we can apply in order to structure our
  users' interactions with our pieces. Note that there aren't any new
  code constructs in this tutorial. Instead, we will look at
  structural concepts in some code snippets I have for you to read
  which demonstrate some common patterns used for interactivity. You
  should recognize some pieces from earlier!

    short: About Loops

      To build up these ideas, we will create a simulation which
      involves spinning three wheels of color to combine red, green,
      and blue together. We will use the concept of gameplay loops
      from video game design to create a three loop structure:

      - We start with the idea that there some repeated action a
        user is doing moment to moment. This is called the core
        loop. Our core loop will be spinning a wheel to get to a
        desired color within that wheel (certain amount of red,
        for example).
      - However, the core loop can be placed within larger
        loops. For example, while our core loop is changing one
        individual color component (how much red, green, blue),
        our "secondary loop" is trying to achieve a specific
        combined color across all three color components.
      - Finally, our "tertiary loop" may be comparing different
        colors: the current color selected against the memory of
        past colors.

      Note that the loops sometimes exist as explicit pieces of the
      code: specific functions supporting one loop or the other.
      However, sometimes the loops emerge from the user's experience
      of a piece.

    short: Simulation
    long: Building the simulation without interactivity
    markdown: |
      With that outline in mind, let's go ahead and build this
      simulation without interactivity first. Try to read my
      [first static version of this code](https://gist.github.com/sampottinger/cedbc6fa9c4579d381b6d22b687da7a7)
      given what you learned from the other skills labs. These colors
      come from
      [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).
      Give that a run and see what you think. Before
      continuing, try changing the radius.
  - name: loops
    short: Loops
    long: Adding interactivity to the simulation
    markdown: |
      Next, let's add in the interactivity! Take a look at my
      [second interactive version of this code](https://gist.github.com/sampottinger/34d0b9bd0200abae03408587974deff3).
      After reading it, give it a run. Try making the lightest and darkest color you can.
      Can you feel the different loops? How does the experience feel if
      you change the rotation speed?
  - name: terminology
    short: Terminology
    long: Understanding verbs and actions in game design
    markdown: |
      Finally, a quick note about terminology. Some game designers
      would say that:

      - There are three loops: a core, secondary, and tertiary
        loop.
      - There is one "verb" or one "action" which is "hover"
        using the mouse.

      Indeed, those designers would say there is only one verb by
      which the user can interact with the simulation even if they can
      use that action in diffrent contexts (different wheels) which
      make it feel like three verbs.

      We've brought the idea of the user back into our sketches. Let's
      finish up this Skills Lab in
      <a href="/labs/resources_data.html">Tutorial 11</a> to learn
      about adding data.
