  In our
  <a href="/labs/features_form.html">previous tutorial</a>
  which explored form as a preattentive feature, we investigated
  drawing different shapes. In this tutorial, we continue Skills Lab 3
  by looking at our next preattentive features color. Indeed, color
  is one part of a broader set of glyph attributes often referred to
  simply as style. This suite of options can help as important
  encoding device and, when used together with other preattentive
  features, can help increase data density.

      Our glyphs can actually have multiple potential colors at the
      same time. However, the first step is finding the color we want.
      We discussed some options in class:

      and
      <a href="https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/" target="_blank"
          >I Want Hue</a
      >
      both provide good options. If you have Python installed on your
      machine, you might also take a look at

      tool is

      is the fill color for a shape. Let's use circles to demonstrate!

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_fill("#a6cee3")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.show()</pre

      With our circles overlapping, we notice that what is drawn first
      goes at the bottom. We can control transparency to create layered effects.

      In addition to fill, shapes can have a stroke or outline. Learn how to
      control stroke colors and create shapes with just outlines.
  - name: weight

      The thickness of strokes can be controlled with weight settings.
      This is useful for emphasis and visual hierarchy.
