  In our
  <a href="/labs/features_form.html">previous tutorial</a>
  which explored form as a preattentive feature, we investigated
  drawing different shapes. In this tutorial, we continue Skills Lab 3
  by looking at our next preattentive features: color. Indeed, color
  is one part of a broader set of glyph attributes often referred to
  simply as style. This suite of options can help as important
  encoding device and, when used together with other preattentive
  features, can help increase data density.

      Our glyphs can actually have multiple potential colors at the
      same time. However, the first step is finding the color we want.
      We discussed some options in class:
      [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)
      and
      [I Want Hue](https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/)
      both provide good options. If you have Python installed on your
      machine, you might also take a look at
      [Viscm](https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm?tab=readme-ov-file).
      Finally, if you just need to manipulate some colors, a great
      tool is
      [HSL Color Picker](https://hslpicker.com/#ffd900),
      which can work on multiple color spaces at the same time. All
      that said, many (maybe most) tools will work with hex codes or
      offer hex codes as an option. I'll be using those color codes
      below but you can see what they correspond to (and change them)
      using HSL Color Picker. Indeed, many of these colors will come
      from ColorBrewer. On that note, be sure to check out a short
      [hex code primer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-hex-code-colors-work-how-to-choose-colors-without-a-color-picker/)
      if you are unfamiliar with color hex codes.
  - name: fill
    short: Fill
    long: Learn to set fill colors for shapes
    html: >
      The easiest place to start for styling in
      <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/">Sketchingpy</a>
      is the fill color for a shape. Let's use circles to demonstrate!
      Here, we can draw circles with different colors as well one
      circle which has no fill (will pass through to any figures drawn
      behind):

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_fill("#a6cee3")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Try using some of our color tools to specify a different fill
      color!
  - name: transparency
    short: Transparency
    long: Learn to use transparency and alpha channels
    html: >
      With our circles overlapping, we notice that what is drawn first
      goes at the bottom and is obsurced by whatever is drawn
      afterwards. This is called the
      <a
          href="https://bcalabs.org/subject/painter-algorithm-in-computer-graphics"
          >Painter's Algorithm</a
      >
      which basically says you should draw your scene from back to
      front. Let's let the user peer through those overlapping shapes
      though by adding transparency to our color. Appending two
      additional numbers to our hex codes specifies opacity where 00
      means fully transparent and FF means fully opaque.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_fill("#a6cee399")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_fill("#b2df8a99")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Try changing the order in which the colors are set and the
      opacity part of the color code.
  - name: stroke
    short: Stroke
    long: Learn to set stroke (outline) colors for shapes
    html: >
      So far, we've been manipulating the insides of our circles.
      Let's change the outsides. Same thing as before, let's have one
      circle that's different.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_stroke("#1f78b4")
      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_fill("#C0C0C0")
      sketch.clear_stroke()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_stroke("#33a02c")
      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Try changing the colors again. When the area is smaller, is the
      contrast needed for readability higher?
  - name: weight
    short: Weight
    long: Learn to control stroke weight and thickness
    html: >
      Let's continue that thought around the size of these areas. We
      change the stroke width through its weight:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_stroke_weight(3)

      sketch.set_stroke("#1f78b4")
      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_fill("#C0C0C0")
      sketch.clear_stroke()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.set_stroke("#33a02c")
      sketch.clear_fill()
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, 250, 100, 100)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Try changing the strokes such that the first and last circle
      have different weights.

    short: Context

    html: >
      Before we move on to the transformation matrix, we have a chance
      to play with some of the concepts around relative color
      interpretation and figure / ground as discussed in lectures. Try
      this sketch out for a moment which uses colors which could be
      useful for a quantitative scale:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.clear('#FFFFFF')

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode("radius")

      def draw_circles(y):
      sketch.set_stroke("#000000")

      sketch.set_fill("#edf8fb")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, y, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_fill("#b2e2e2")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(200, y, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_fill("#66c2a4")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, y, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_fill("#2ca25f")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(300, y, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_fill("#006d2c")
      sketch.draw_ellipse(350, y, 20, 20)

      draw_circles(125)

      sketch.set_rect_mode("corner")
      sketch.clear_stroke()
      sketch.set_fill("#555555")
      sketch.draw_rect(0, 250, 500, 250)

      draw_circles(375)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Note that this uses
      <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/clear.html">clear</a>.
      Let's assume for a moment that this is a
      <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/heatmap.html">heatmap</a>.
      We don't have a color scale listed. However, based on the
      background, which dot do you think corresponds to the highest
      and lowest number? Does your answer change depending on the
      background? It is possible that, using the concept of figure /
      ground from lecture, you may think the color with the highest
      luminance contrast corresponds to the highest number. That is a
      common recommendation! In other words, the rightmost dot may be
      seen as the highest in the top part of the graphic and the
      leftmost dot may be seen as the highest in the bottom part of
      the graphic.
