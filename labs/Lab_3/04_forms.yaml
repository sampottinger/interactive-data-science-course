  which rounded off Skills Labs 1 and 2, we explored object-oriented
  programming through building an interactive simulation. In this
  tutorial, we start Skills Lab 3 by looking at the first preattentive
  feature form. To explore this valuable tool for data visualization,
  we will investigate drawing different shapes. For the next few
  tutorials, it is recommened you use the Sketchingpy

  - name: ellipse
    short: Ellipse
    long: Learn to draw ellipses and circles with different modes
    body: >
      We have seen some circles already but we will start our journey
      through forms with ellipses. An ellipse is a circular object
      that is a circle if the width and height are the same. These can
      be useful for structures like
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/scatter.html"
          target="_blank"
          >scatterplots</a
      >
      or
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/bubble.html"
          target="_blank"
          :
          >bubble plots</a
      >. To explore our options, we will look at different "modes" for
      how to indicate the shape of an ellipse. Let's start by drawing
      a simple ellipse sized according to radius:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Go ahead and run this a few times. Each time try changing the
      following:

      <ul>
          <li>
              Change ellipse mode from radius to the following:
              radius, center, corner, corners.
          </li>
          <li>
              Change the parameters provided to draw_ellipse. For
              example, change from (250, 250, 10, 10) to (100, 150,
              10, 20).
          </li>
      </ul>
      How does the figure change as a result of your edits? The mode
      impacts how the parameters to draw_ellipse are interpreted. For
      example, in radius, center, and corner, the first two parameters
      are the position and last two parameters are the size. However,
      for corners, all four parameters are positions. Here is a
      comparison of all four modes:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('corners')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('center')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('corner')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      To formalize what you just learned, check out the
      <a

      >.
  - name: rectangle
    short: Rectangle
    long: Learn to draw rectangles with different modes
    body: >
      Let's continue to rectangles. These can be useful for things
      like
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/barplot.html"
          target="_blank"
          >bar plots</a
      >,
      <a
          href="https://datavizproject.com/data-type/butterfly-chart/"
          target="_blank"
          >butterfly plots</a
      >, or
      <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/treemap.html"
          >treemaps</a
      >. This works similarly to ellipses and, even though it seems a
      little counter-intutitive at first, these can also have radius.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Let's do the same experiments as before:

      <ul>
          <li>
              Change rect mode from radius to the following: radius,
              center, corner, corners.
          </li>
          <li>
              Change the parameters provided to draw_rect. For
              example, change from (250, 250, 10, 10) to (100, 150,
              10, 20).
          </li>
      </ul>

      Once again, let's try comparing by piling these rectangles on
      top of each other.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('corners')
      sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('center')
      sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('corner')
      sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Once again, see the reference for
      <a

  - name: arc
    short: Arc
    long: Learn to draw arcs and partial circles
    body: >
      I want to get to custom shapes in a moment but there's one last
      element to put into your tool chest. A quick glance at the chart
      wizard in spreadsheet software might make it seem like arcs
      aren't that important but, on the contrary, they can be used for
      many very useful structures even if they are less common outside
      of a
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/pie.html"
          target="_blank"
          >pie chart</a
      >. Indeed, arcs are an essential ingredient in
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/arc.html"
          target="_blank"
          >arc diagrams</a
      >,
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sunburst.html"
          target="_blank"
          >sunbursts</a
      >,
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/chord.html"
          target="_blank"
          >chord diagrams</a
      >, and
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/donut.html"
          target="_blank"
          >doughnut charts</a
      >
      among others. Start with this code which draws a simple arc:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
      sketch.set_angle_mode('degrees')
      sketch.draw_arc(250, 250, 40, 40, 0, 90)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Now, let's do a similar investigation as we did for ellipses and
      rectangles:

      <ul>
          <li>
              Change arc mode from radius to the following: radius,
              center, corner, corners.
          </li>
          <li>Change the parameters provided to draw_arc.</li>
      </ul>

      Learn more at the
      <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/draw_arc.html"
          >draw_arc documentation</a
      >. Note that we are using degrees here to specify angles. You
      can change to radians using
      <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/set_angle_mode.html"
          >set_angle_mode</a
      >.
  - name: line
    short: Line
    long: Learn to draw lines and connected line segments
    body: >
      So far, we've worked with pre-defined shapes. However,
      Sketchingpy lets us make new forms as well. To explore how we
      can go about creating these shapes, let's briefly return to
      <a
          href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/draw_line.html"
          target="_blank"
          >draw_line</a
      >
      as we saw in previous tutorials. Here's an example:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.draw_line(230, 270, 270, 270)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      However, let's do this another way. We will see why this might
      help in a moment:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
      shape.end()
      sketch.draw_shape(shape)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      While this seems like extra code to achieve the same result at
      first, let's take this one step further with multiple connected
      line segments which could be useful for things like
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/line.html"
          target="_blank"
          >line charts</a
      >
      and
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/area.html"
          target="_blank"
          >area plots</a
      >
      or custom forms.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(250, 230)
      shape.end()
      sketch.draw_shape(shape)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Note that Sketchingpy tries to color in the shape to make a
      figure. If you want to stop that, use sketch.clear_fill before
      calling sketch.draw_shape but we will investigate that more
      later.
  - name: curve
    short: Curve
    long: Learn to draw bezier curves
    body: >
      Some charts like
      <a
          href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/sankey.html"
          target="_blank"
          >Sankey Diagrams</a
      >
      require non-arc curves which are very often achieved through
      <a
          href="https://rfong.github.io/creative-coding/bezier/"
          target="_blank"
          >bezier curves</a
      >
      which have two "control points" which you can think of as
      "pulling" the edge away from a straight path from start to
      finish. We can draw those too! Let's modify our shape just a
      little bit:

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
      shape.add_bezier_to(280, 250, 250, 230, 270, 210)
      shape.end()
      sketch.draw_shape(shape)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Try changing the parameters a bit but also see the
      <a
          href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/add_bezier_to.html"
          target="_blank"
          >documentation for add_bezier_to</a
      >.
  - name: shape
    short: Shape
    long: Create custom shapes combining different elements
    body: >
      Now we can tie it all together. Let's make a custom shape
      (triangle) and put it next to some of the prebuilt shapes
      (circle and square):

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 20, 20)

      shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
      shape.add_line_to(250, 230)
      shape.close()
      sketch.draw_shape(shape)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
      sketch.draw_rect(350, 250, 20, 20)

      sketch.show()
      </pre>

      Note that there are two ways to finish a shape:
      <a
          href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/close.html"
          target="_blank"
          >end</a
      >
      or
      <a
          href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/close.html"
          target="_blank"
          >close</a
      >. Try changing close to end to learn more.
