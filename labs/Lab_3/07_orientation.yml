  In our <a href="/labs/features_position.html">previous tutorial</a>
  we explored position as a preattentive feature. Specifically, we
  investigated how to control the location of our shapes through
  manipulation of the transformation matrix. However, we can do more
  than just change the origin (0, 0 point) of our coordinate system,
  we can rotate it as well! In this tutorial, we conclude Skills Lab 3
  by looking at our final preattentive feature: orientation.

      We will start by doing a global rotation. This also changes the
      transformation matrix. However, give this a run and you might
      notice a problem.


      <pre>import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
      sketch.set_angle_mode('degrees')

      size = 5
      for rotation in range(0, 12):
          sketch.draw_rect(200, 0, size, size)
          sketch.rotate(30)
          size += 5

      sketch.show()
      </pre>


      Our work is off the screen! Try changing the position of the
      squares.

      Using that first sketch as motiviation, it is common to
      translate prior to rotation to indicate the point around which
      the rotation should occur.


      <pre>import sketchingpy

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

      sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
      sketch.set_angle_mode('degrees')

      def draw_at(x, y, color):
          sketch.push_transform()
          sketch.push_style()

          sketch.translate(x, y)

          sketch.set_fill(color)

          size = 5
          for rotation in range(0, 12):
              sketch.draw_rect(100, 0, size, size)
              sketch.rotate(30)
              size += 2

          sketch.pop_style()
          sketch.pop_transform()

      sketch.translate(250, 250)

      draw_at(0, -100, "#1b9e7750")
      draw_at(-100, 100, "#d95f0250")
      draw_at(100, 100, "#7570b350")

      sketch.show()
      </pre>


      It is also common to push and pop within a function so that you
      can keep track of what transforms have occurred.
