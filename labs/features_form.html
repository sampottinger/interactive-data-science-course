            which rounded off Skills Labs 1 and 2, we explored object-oriented
            programming through building an interactive simulation. In this
            tutorial, we start Skills Lab 3 by looking at the first preattentive
            feature: form. To explore this valuable tool for data visualization,
            we will investigate drawing different shapes. For the next few

                <h2>Ellipse</h2>
                We have seen some circles already but we will start our journey
                through forms with ellipses. An ellipse is a circular object
                that is a circle if the width and height are the same. These can
                be useful for structures like
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/scatter.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >scatterplots</a
                >
                or
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/bubble.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    :
                    >bubble plots</a
                >. To explore our options, we will look at different "modes" for
                how to indicate the shape of an ellipse. Let's start by drawing
                a simple ellipse sized according to radius:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Go ahead and run this a few times. Each time try changing the
                following:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Change ellipse mode from radius to the following:
                        radius, center, corner, corners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Change the parameters provided to draw_ellipse. For
                        example, change from (250, 250, 10, 10) to (100, 150,
                        10, 20).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                How does the figure change as a result of your edits? The mode
                impacts how the parameters to draw_ellipse are interpreted. For
                example, in radius, center, and corner, the first two parameters
                are the position and last two parameters are the size. However,
                for corners, all four parameters are positions. Here is a
                comparison of all four modes:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('corners')
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('center')
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('corner')
sketch.draw_ellipse(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.show()</pre

            <section id="rectangle">
                <h2>Rectangle</h2>
                Let's continue to rectangles. These can be useful for things
                like
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/barplot.html"

                    >butterfly plots</a
                >, or
                <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/treemap.html"
                    >treemaps</a
                >. This works similarly to ellipses and, even though it seems a
                little counter-intutitive at first, these can also have radius.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Let's do the same experiments as before:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Change rect mode from radius to the following: radius,
                        center, corner, corners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Change the parameters provided to draw_rect. For
                        example, change from (250, 250, 10, 10) to (100, 150,
                        10, 20).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Once again, let's try comparing by piling these rectangles on
                top of each other.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_rect_mode('corners')
sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_rect_mode('center')
sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.set_rect_mode('corner')
sketch.draw_rect(250, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Once again, see the reference for

                <h2>Arc</h2>

                I want to get to custom shapes in a moment but there's one last
                element to put into your tool chest. A quick glance at the chart
                wizard in spreadsheet software might make it seem like arcs
                aren't that important but, on the contrary, they can be used for
                many very useful structures even if they are less common outside
                of a

                >
                among others. Start with this code which draws a simple arc:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
sketch.set_angle_mode('degrees')
sketch.draw_arc(250, 250, 40, 40, 0, 90)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Now, let's do a similar investigation as we did for ellipses and
                rectangles:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Change arc mode from radius to the following: radius,
                        center, corner, corners.
                    </li>
                    <li>Change the parameters provided to draw_arc.</li>
                </ul>

                Learn more at the

                    >draw_arc documentation</a
                >. Note that we are using degrees here to specify angles. You
                can change to radians using

            <section id="line">
                <h2>Line</h2>
                So far, we've worked with pre-defined shapes. However,
                Sketchingpy lets us make new forms as well. To explore how we
                can go about creating these shapes, let's briefly return to
                <a
                    href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/draw_line.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >draw_line</a
                >
                as we saw in previous tutorials. Here's an example:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.draw_line(230, 270, 270, 270)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                However, let's do this another way. We will see why this might
                help in a moment:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
shape.end()
sketch.draw_shape(shape)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                While this seems like extra code to achieve the same result at
                first, let's take this one step further with multiple connected
                line segments which could be useful for things like
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/line.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >line charts</a
                >
                and
                <a
                    href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/area.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >area plots</a
                >
                or custom forms.

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
shape.add_line_to(250, 230)
shape.end()
sketch.draw_shape(shape)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Note that Sketchingpy tries to color in the shape to make a
                figure. If you want to stop that, use sketch.clear_fill before
                calling sketch.draw_shape but we will investigate that more
                later.

                which have two "control points" which you can think of as
                "pulling" the edge away from a straight path from start to
                finish. We can draw those too! Let's modify our shape just a
                little bit:

                <pre>
import sketchingpy

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
shape.add_bezier_to(280, 250, 250, 230, 270, 210)
shape.end()
sketch.draw_shape(shape)

sketch.show()</pre
                >

                Try changing the parameters a bit but also see the
                <a
                    href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/add_bezier_to.html"

            <section id="shape">
                <h2>Shape</h2>
                Now we can tie it all together. Let's make a custom shape
                (triangle) and put it next to some of the prebuilt shapes
                (circle and square):

                <pre>

sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 500)

sketch.set_ellipse_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_ellipse(150, 250, 20, 20)

shape = sketch.start_shape(230, 270)
shape.add_line_to(270, 270)
shape.add_line_to(250, 230)
shape.close()
sketch.draw_shape(shape)

sketch.set_rect_mode('radius')
sketch.draw_rect(350, 250, 20, 20)

sketch.show()</pre
