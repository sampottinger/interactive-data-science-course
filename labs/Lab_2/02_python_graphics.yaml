  In the <a href="/labs/python_intro.html">previous tutorial</a>, we
  explored the basics of Python. We told the computer about new
  actions that could be taken (functions) and we saw how names
  (variables) allow us to manipulate things over time. However, we
  were confined to communicating with the computer through text. In
  this tutorial, we will start drawing: learning how to communicate
  through graphics. People who do this kind of work often refer to it

  built in our <a href="/labs/python_intro.html">last exercise</a>.
  You may hear that phrase thrown around a bit during the semester.

    long: Introduction to drawing a simple line and making it interactive
    body: >
      We will start by drawing a simple line. In the process, we will
      explore the coordinate system and understand how pixels are
      layed out within a sketch. Finally, we will add in the "user" as
      a component of our designs. Specifically, we will draw a line
      from the center of the screen to the user's cursor
      interactively. Note that, as folks reading this tutorial may
      have very different levels of prior experience in Python, I'll
      be explaining things in a lot of detail with expandable sections
      along the way. However, if you are very familiar with Python
      already, you may choose just to read through the code snippets.

      <details>
          <summary>About the user</summary>
          <p>
              There's some debate as to how to refer to the human on
              the other side of the screen using a piece of software.
              I'll often just lean on the phrase "user" as it is
              common but you may also hear people talk about the
              audience (like of a piece of art), the reader (like of a
              visualization) or the player (like of an interactive
              piece). Each framing is useful in different ways but we
              we will return to this debate later.

    long: Get started with Sketchingpy for creative coding
    body: >
      <p>
          We are going to build full programs using
          <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/">Sketchingpy</a>, a
          technology which supports creative coding in Python across
          desktop and web. This will give us access to graphics.
      </p>

      <p>
          We should talk briefly about how we will do this
          programming. We used a computational notebook in our
          <a href="/labs/python_intro.html">previous tutorial</a> to
          try out little snippets of code. While notebooks are
          excellent for analysis and more traditional programming, I
          recommend that you start building these interaction-heavy
          experiences through an
          <a href="https://editor.sketchingpy.org/"
              >online sketchbook</a
          >. The idea of a sketchbook is common in the creative coding
          community as an equivalent to computational notebooks and,
          with Sketchingpy, all you need is a web browser! Still, the
          choice is yours.
      </p>

      <p>
          If you are using Python locally, you can instead
          <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/guides/start.html"
              >install Sketchingpy on your own machine</a
          >. Otherwise, go ahead and open up the
          <a href="https://editor.sketchingpy.org/"
              >online sketchbook</a
          >
          before going to the next step.

    short: Libraries
    long: Import the Sketchingpy and time libraries
    body: >
      We are going to reuse some code from some other developers to
      help us. Specifically, we will import the Sketchingpy and time
      libraries into our project.

      <pre>
      import sketchingpy
      import time</pre

          <summary>About libraries</summary>
          <p>
              We
              <a href="/labs/python_intro.html"
                  >discussed previously</a
              >
              that a program is like an empty world in which we
              construct new things with our thoughts. We express those
              thoughts through code, building the items which occupy
              those worlds and the rules that govern their behavior.
              We can build these worlds from scratch but sometimes it
              helps to pull in the work of other developers. We can do
              this through "imports" which reach into another
              developer's world and borrow variables from them. These
              two lines of code copy "sketchingpy" and "time" into our
              world as variables. These kinds of variables that you
              can bring in from other worlds are called libraries.
              Note that we will see soon how to make variables that
              contain other variables but sketchingpy.Sketch2D says
              use Sketch2D from within Sketchingpy.

  - name: sketch
    short: Sketch
    long: Create a 2D sketch canvas
    body: >
      In the creative coding community, we often use the term
      "sketches" to refer to our programs. Sometimes sketches are just
      little doodles or early ideas we want to get onto the screen and
      see how they feel. Other times, they can be large software
      projects spanning many files of code to produce complex
      graphics. We can create a 2D sketch using the following:

      <pre>sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(500, 400)</pre>

      This code builds a small space 500 pixels wide and 400 pixels
      tall where we can draw.

      <details>
          <summary>About pixels and coordinates</summary>
          <p>
              Some sketches are used to display things on a screen.
              Others are used to save images to files. In both cases,
              the smallest unit we can work with is called a pixel.
              Pixels are little lights that make up your screen that
              are turned on and off or changed color to show the user
              graphics. These are arranged in a grid which we refer to
              as a coordinate system. In a 2D sketch, the upper most
              left pixel is at horizontal position 0 and veritical
              position 0. Meanwhile, in our sketch, the bottom most
              right pixel is at horizontal position 500 and vertical
              position 400. We tend to refer to horizontal position as
              x and veritical position as y.
          </p>
      </details>
  - name: lines
    short: Drawing lines
    long: Learn how to draw lines on the sketch
    body: >
      Let's draw a line:

      <pre>sketch.draw_line(500 / 2, 400 / 2, 100, 50)</pre>

      This will draw a line across the sketch.

      <details>
          <summary>About draw_line</summary>
          <p>
              Here we are using a function called "draw_line" and the
              first number ("parameter") refers to the x position
              where to start the line and the second number refers to
              the y position where to start the line. The third and
              fourth numbers are the x and y positions of where to
              end. We say sketch.draw_line because we are telling the
              computer to execute the draw_line function within our
              sketch. Learn more about draw_line in the
              <a
                  href="https://sketchingpy.org/reference/draw_line.html"
                  >Sketchingpy reference</a
              >.
          </p>
      </details>

      Let's actually re-write that previous line as follows (go ahead
      and paste this in):

      <pre>
      center_x = 500 / 2
      center_y = 400 / 2
      end_x = 100
      end_y = 50
      sketch.draw_line(center_x, center_y, end_x, end_y)</pre
      >

      That is a little easier to read maybe. We are drawing a line
      from the center of the screen to the upper left. Finally, we
      need to tell the computer to show the sketch on the screen (as
      opposed to saving it to a file, for example):

      <pre>sketch.show()</pre>

      Now that we have something interesting, let's run this sketch.
      Try changing the numbers to see what happens to what is shown on
      the screen.

    body: >
      Our program right now feels a little
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/64895205">dead</a>. It just draws a
      line on the screen and ends. What if it could do things in
      repetition like maybe change the end position where the line is
      drawn? Try the following (put it before the line that says
      sketch.show):

      <pre>
      start_time = time.time()

      def draw_moving_line(self):
          seconds = time.time() - start_time
          pixels_per_second = 5
          offset = seconds * pixels_per_second
          sketch.draw_line(250, 200, 100, 50 + offset)

      sketch.on_step(draw_moving_line)</pre

          <p>
              Note that, if you open my file, the lines starting with
              a hash mark are called comments. The computer ignores
              everything after the hash until the next line. I'm using
              comments here to indicate what the file does and what
              license it is under. To learn more about licenses, see

          >The little snippet of code we just ran</a
      >
      has a function that we want to have called each moment the
      program executes. For the computer, moments are very fast and
      called "steps" with roughly 30 steps per second. In other words,
      we are instructing the computer to call draw_moving_line each
      step that the sketch takes. Within that function, we instruct
      the computer to draw a line and change the ending y coordinate
      by 5 pixels for each second that has ellapsed. How do we know
      how long it has been? Let's look at time.

      <details>
          <summary>Terminology surrounding steps</summary>
          <p>
              Some frameworks call these moments steps. However,
              others may call them frames, redraws, or refreshes. We
              are sticking with the terminology used by Sketchingpy.
              That said, you may also hear "FPS" which stands for
              frames per second. In our case, this is steps per
              second.

    short: Time
    long: Learn how to track time in your sketch
    body: >
      Each time the computer calls draw_moving_line, we see how many
      seconds it has been since start_time to determine by how much to
      change the end position of the line. This is important because
      sometimes the computer gets busy or interrupted as it
      multi-tasks. So, the time between each step is not always
      excatly the same. Refering back to time.time allows us to make
      sure things are smooth even if there is an interruption.

              is a function that returns the number of seconds since a
              specific moment in 1970 called the
              <a
                  href="https://www.abis.be/html/en2020-12_UnixEpoch.html"
                  >epoch</a

              used by computers around the world to keep track of what
              time it is. This has been useful for all sorts of stuff,
              especially networking. All that said, we can use it to
              keep track of how long our program has been running.
              When we create the start_time variable, we note down the
              current number of seconds when that line of code is
              executed. Afterwards, We can refer back to start_time
              and new calls to time.time to see how long it has been.
              Note that "time.time" says use the time function from
              the developer of time.

      def draw_moving_line(self):
          seconds = time.time() - start_time

          self.draw_line(250, 200, 100, 50 + offset)</pre

      Go ahead and give it a try! All that said, when programs are
      this small, I understand it feels a little silly to have two
      variables pointing to the same thing. However, we will see in
      the <a href="/labs/python_objects.html">next tutorial</a> when

              We didn't comment on it much but there is something new
              happening within this code. What's really going on with
              "sketch." in the code "sketch.draw_line" that we saw
              above? What's the significance of saying draw_line
              happens within sketch? We will explore that deeper in
              our
              <a href="/labs/python_objects.html">next tutorial</a> as
              we look to using creative coding for simulation and
              visualization.
