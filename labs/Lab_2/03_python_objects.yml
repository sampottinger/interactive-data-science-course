    short: Recap
    long: Review of concepts from previous tutorials
    markdown: >
      In our [first tutorial](/labs/python_intro.html), we
      introduced the idea that computer programs are like empty
      worlds. To populate those worlds, we can give names to numbers
      and text. We can breathe life into those objects by defining the
      rules that dictate their behavior. However, our programs did not
      know about much else on its own beyond what a number is and how
      to do arithmetic with it. In other words, the types of objects
      we could build were limited. In the
      [second tutorial](/labs/python_graphics.html), we
      brought in libraries to make these worlds graphical by leaning
      on the work of other developers that came before us. This let us
      make new types of things even if we were constrained by what
      those prior developers imagined. Finaly, this tutorial explores
      how we can tell the computer about new concepts and how we can
      use that power to create interactive simulations.

    long: Build a simulation with bouncing balls
    markdown: >
      We will build a simulation in which balls rush out across the
      screen, bouncing off the edges once they reach the ends of the
      sketch. This will demonstrate how to tell the computer about new
      things and how they behave. Additionally, we will let the user
      interact with these balls with the mouse. In each of these
      steps, we will have the computer draw the full path that these
      balls take, creating branch-like structures across the screen.

      <p>
          To tell the computer about a new type of thing, we create a
          class. Specifically, we will make a class for the balls
          which are bouncing around and a simulation which tracks all
          of those balls.

          <summary>About classes</summary>
          <div>
              <p>
                  A class is like the blueprint or the DNA for
                  something (which we call objects). It says what
                  properties (which we call fields) define that
                  something and what behaviors (which we call methods)
                  we can expect from that thing. Here, behaviors mean
                  things that the objects can do or have be done to
                  them. You can think of fields as variables bound to
                  an object and methods as functions tied to an
                  object. Let's explore an example conceptually before
                  actually building a class for a ball.
              </p>

              <p>
                  For this conceptual example, let's return to bank
                  accounts from the first tutorial. It may have fields
                  like owner, balance, and interest rate. These
                  properties define the bank account, offering the
                  information needed for each bank account to
                  function. It may have methods like withdraw,
                  deposit, and give_interest. If we make a BankAccount
                  class, you might have a bank account and I might
                  have a bank account. Each individual bank account is
                  said to be an "instance" of the BankAccount class
                  and each one would have its own owner, balance, and
                  interest rate.

    long: Create a sketch for the simulation
    html: |
      Let's start by making a sketch.

      <pre>import sketchingpy
      import time

      WIDTH = 500  # pixels
      HEIGHT = 400  # pixels

      sketch = sketchingpy.Sketch2D(WIDTH, HEIGHT)</pre>

      Here, Sketch2D is a class and sketch is an instance.

          <summary>About comments and constants</summary>
          <p>
              The # refers to a comment as we might have seen in prior
              example code (anything on the line of code after # is
              ignored by the computer). We also see some variables in
              all caps. We call these constants and, by putting it in
              all caps, we signal to other developers that the value
              of these variables should not change over time
          </p>
      </details>
  - name: ball
    short: Defining a Ball
    long: Create a Ball class with position and velocity
    html: |
      Let's make our first class. Our ball will have an x and y
      position on screen. This ball will also be in motion. We will
      define that movement through velocity as pixels per second in
      the x and y direction. One important method is called "__init__"
      which is called when an instance is first made.

      <pre>class Ball:

        def __init__(self, position_x, position_y, velocity_x, velocity_y):
          self.position_x = position_x
          self.position_y = position_y
          self.velocity_x = velocity_x
          self.velocity_y = velocity_y</pre>

      This snippet creates the concept of a ball. When that ball is
      made, we ask for the position and velocity. Finally, within the
      __init__ method, we create the following fields: position_x,
      position_y, velocity_x, and velocity_y. Remember self from the
      <a href="/labs/python_graphics.html">previous tutorial</a>? Now
      we can see now why it is used: the self parameter refers to the
      instance. By using this parameter, we can manipulate variables
      tied to that individual instance like position_x.

      <details>
          <summary>More about self</summary>
          <p>
              Note that we don't pass self to the method. A parameter
              value for self is inserted behind the scenes by Python.
              In other words, the first parameter to every method is
              always the instance. By convention, the vast majority of
              Python developers call that parameter self. While you
              can technically use whatever name you would like, self
              is very strongly recommended.

  - name: motion
    short: Moving a Ball
    long: Add methods to update ball position and handle bouncing
    html: |
      Now that we have created the fields on a ball, let's define its
      behaviors. The ball will "bounce" by reversing its x and / or y
      velocities. Starting with that:

      <pre>class Ball:

        def __init__(self, position_x, position_y, velocity_x, velocity_y):
          self.position_x = position_x
          self.position_y = position_y
          self.velocity_x = velocity_x
          self.velocity_y = velocity_y

        def reverse_x(self):
          self.velocity_x = self.velocity_x * -1

        def reverse_y(self):
          self.velocity_y = self.velocity_y * -1</pre>

      If we had a ball, we could now call ball.reverse_x() to reverse
      its horizontal direction. Anyway, with that in mind, we now have
      all the pieces needed to make a method which updates the
      position of the ball on each step:

      <pre>def update(self, duration):
        self.position_x = self.position_x + self.velocity_x * duration
        self.position_y = self.position_y + self.velocity_y * duration

        if self.position_x > WIDTH:
          self.position_x = WIDTH
          self.reverse_x()
        elif self.position_x < 0:
          self.position_x = 0
          self.reverse_x()

        if self.position_y > HEIGHT:
          self.position_y = HEIGHT
          self.reverse_y()
        elif self.position_y < 0:
          self.position_y = 0
          self.reverse_y()</pre>

      We will call update on each ball for each step within our
      simulation.

      <details>
          <summary>About offscreen</summary>
          <p>
              Note that our if statements are checking if the ball has
              fallen offscreen. Developers and designers have been
              thinking hard for a long time about what to do when this
              happens. Sometimes, folks will have an object falling
              offscreen appear at the opposite side of the world. This
              is like how one's position on a map continues moving
              right as you move west until you reach the edge but, as
              the Earth is round, you wouldn't fall off but simply
              would appear on the other side of the map. This is
              called wrapping. For us, we simply have the ball bounce
              off the edges. This is an "in-bounds" behavior that
              imagines that nothing exists past the edge of our flat
              coordinate system.

  - name: simulation
    short: Defining a Simulation
    long: Create a Simulation class to manage multiple balls
    markdown: |
      It is common to make a class for an overall simulation as well.
      This can be used to keep track of time and the different
      instances that make up the simulated world.

      ```python
      class Simulation:

          def __init__(self):
              self.balls = [
                  Ball(WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2, -10, -10),
                  Ball(WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2, -10, 10),
                  Ball(WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2, 10, 0)
              ]
              self.last_time = time.time()
      ```

      Notice how we are making three instances of the Ball class.
      Let's also add an update method to the Simulation class which
      updates each of those balls using a loop.

      ```python
          def update(self):
              new_time = time.time()
              duration = new_time - self.last_time
              self.last_time = new_time

              for ball in self.balls:
                  ball.update(duration)
      ```

      Now, we have everything we need to simulate this system. In the
      next step, we will draw the state of the system after updating
      it.
  - name: draw
    short: Draw the System
    long: Visualize the simulation by drawing the balls
    markdown: |
      We are simulating the system but we haven't yet made it visible.
      Let's go ahead and create a new simulation and register a
      function to call on each step of the sketch:

      ```python
      simulation = Simulation()

      def update_and_draw_balls(self):
          simulation.update()
          for ball in simulation.balls:
              sketch.draw_ellipse(ball.position_x, ball.position_y, 2, 2)

      sketch.on_step(update_and_draw_balls)
      sketch.show()
      ```

      Here's some [more info about draw_ellipse](https://sketchingpy.org/reference/draw_ellipse.html). Need some help? [Here's what my code looks like](https://gist.github.com/sampottinger/49e6c897eae12c4a3e7bf161d80fc22b). Anyway, let's go ahead and let this run. Try also changing the initial velocities of the balls or their starting positions. How does that change the patterns displayed to the user?
  - name: mouse
    short: Get the Mouse
    long: Add mouse position tracking to the simulation
    markdown: |
      Next, we want the user to be able to interact with the
      simulation through the mouse. For this, we need to route that
      information to each Ball instance. Let's start by updating the
      on_step callback:

      ```python
      def update_and_draw_balls(self):
          mouse = sketch.get_mouse()
          mouse_x = mouse.get_pointer_x()
          mouse_y = mouse.get_pointer_y()

          simulation.update(mouse_x, mouse_y)

          for ball in simulation.balls:
              sketch.draw_ellipse(ball.position_x, ball.position_y, 2, 2)
      ```

      Next, we need to update the simulation (the Simulation class) to
      take that information:

      ```python
          def update(self, mouse_x, mouse_y):
              new_time = time.time()
              duration = new_time - self.last_time
              self.last_time = new_time

              for ball in self.balls:
                  ball.update(duration, mouse_x, mouse_y)
      ```

      Finally, we need to have the Ball class understand how to
      respond. This will take a little bit of thinking.
  - name: interacting
    short: Interacting with the Mouse
    long: Implement collision detection with the mouse cursor
    markdown: |
      At a high level, we want to see if the mouse is near the ball.
      If it is, we then change the x velocity if the ball bounces
      against the cursor horizontally or we change the y velocity if
      the ball bounces against the cursor vertically. Let's start by
      writing out this high level logic by changing the Ball's update
      method:

      ```python
          def update(self, duration, mouse_x, mouse_y):
              self.position_x = self.position_x + self.velocity_x * duration
              self.position_y = self.position_y + self.velocity_y * duration

              if self.position_x > WIDTH:
                  self.position_x = WIDTH
                  self.reverse_x()
              elif self.position_x < 0:
                  self.position_x = 0
                  self.reverse_x()

              if self.position_y > HEIGHT:
                  self.position_y = HEIGHT
                  self.reverse_y()
              elif self.position_y < 0:
                  self.position_y = 0
                  self.reverse_y()

              if self.get_is_near_mouse(mouse_x, mouse_y):
                  if self.get_hit_mouse_in_direction(self.position_x, mouse_x, self.velocity_x):
                      self.reverse_x()
                  elif self.get_hit_mouse_in_direction(self.position_y, mouse_y, self.velocity_y):
                      self.reverse_y()
      ```

      This code provides a translation of our thoughts in English to
      our thoughts in Python. However, there are a few items missing.
      Let's start by adding a new method in Ball called
      get_is_near_mouse:

      ```python
          def get_is_near_mouse(self, mouse_x, mouse_y):
              x_near = abs(mouse_x - self.position_x) < 10
              y_near = abs(mouse_y - self.position_y) < 10
              return x_near and y_near
      ```

      Here we are using a function that is built into Python called
      abs which returns the absolute value of a number. If the ball is
      within 10 pixels, we say that it has collided with the cursor
      and we check in which direction the velocity should change. For
      that, let's add a new method called get_hit_mouse_in_direction:

      ```python
          def get_hit_mouse_in_direction(self, coordinate, mouse, velocity):
              if mouse > coordinate and velocity > 0:
                  distance = mouse - coordinate
                  return distance < 10
              elif mouse < coordinate and velocity < 0:
                  distance = mouse - coordinate
                  return distance > -10
              else:
                  return False
      ```

      This function allows us to check if the mouse was hit along a
      certain axis. Both if statements see if the mouse was moving
      towards the cursor in the given direction and then we return
      True or False depending on if the ball was close along that
      given axis.

          other developers.
      </p>

      <p>
          First, if I were writing this code for my job, I would have
          said self._position_x instead of self.position_x. This
          leading underscore tells other developers not to modify that
          value directly and to, instead, access it through the
          methods of class. We say that we are indicating that
          position_x is a "private" field. Similarly, there are some
          methods that I would make private as they are only used
          internally within the object like self._reverse_x instead of
          self.reverse_x.
      </p>

      <details>
          <summary>Why private attributes</summary>

          <p>
              Some developers think that all fields should be private
              such that changes to variables on an instance can only
              happen through public methods (those without a leading
              underscore). To understand why, let's return to the
              example of BankAccount. Maybe changes to the balance
              require other actions like sending the owner a note.
              Specifically, imagine that we need to inform the owner
              by text each time money is withdrawn. Of course, we
              could add that logic to the withdraw method. However,
              what if a developer using the BankAccount class started
              doing account.balance = account.balance + 10? That extra
              logic within the withdraw method wouldn't execute if
              someone accessed balance directly. In this case, we want
              to make balance private to ensure developers go through
              the methods of the class.
          </p>
      </details>

      <p>
          Many developers typically make things private by default and
          then decide which select methods should be public. This
          dictates how code outside the object should interact with
          each instance. We say that this is defining an "interface"
          that is used "publicly" outside the object. This ensure all
          of the actions that need to happen are taken care of as the
          fields or "state" of the object changes over time. We can do
          this for our simulation too. What would you make private?
          Note that this concept is called
          <a
              href="https://medium.com/@heyamit10/encapsulation-in-object-oriented-programming-f10ed08c2998"
              >encapsulation</a
          >.
      </p>

      <p>
          Second, I want to discuss what """ does. This defines a
          special kind of comment called a
          <a
              href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/docstrings-python"
              >docstring</a
          >
          which tells another developer that this is an important
          comment that defines how to use a file, a class, a function,
          or a method. Some code editors can also take advantage of
          these docstrings to help provide contextual information

      We've reached the end of our first set of skills labs! If you
      are taking the course with me during the semester, please note
      that lectures (and recordings) will go back to normal for a bit
      instead of using the flipped format. So, there won't be a
      recording sent out ahead of our next class time. If you are
      doing this on your own time, you can return to the lectures or
      continue onwards to [Skills Lab 4](/labs/features_form.html).
