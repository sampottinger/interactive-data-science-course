            We've explored data visualization concepts in the general sense so
            the lessons learned from this class can go with you regardless of
            what technology (including pen and paper!) you use to realize your
            ideas. Today we will explore JavaScript (sometimes called ECMAScript
            or just JS) as another option. Note that this skills lab is
            optional.

                <p>
                    There are a lot of technologies out there to make data
                    visualizations. Some like
                    <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank"
                        >Tableau</a
                    >
                    don't require code. Others like
                    <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega</a> are
                    programming languages just for data visualization. The
                    concepts we've explored in this class translate across all
                    of these different options and, indeed, many use similar
                    teminology to that which we've explored together in class.
                    This means that, even if you are moving into a new
                    technology, you should see some familiar ideas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even so, note that we've often centered our discussion on
                    Sketchingpy which has given us an opportunity to program for
                    the web through Python. This language was used as this
                    technology is more commonly known amoung the students
                    participating this semester. It is also one of the more
                    frequently used languages in the scientific computing space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While professional data visualization designers use Python,
                    our community also uses other languages as well. In
                    particular, JavaScript is a popular option as it also runs
                    within the browser. We will explore JavaScript here. The
                    good news is Skechingpy is similar to some JavaScript
                    libraries leveraged for interactive data graphics so the
                    transition isn't too hard.

                <div>
                    <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">P5</a> is the
                    JavaScript equivalent to
                    <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, one of the
                    libraries that really blew open the doors to interactive
                    data graphics. Also, working with P5 isn't too dissimilar to
                    working with Sketchingpy. Go ahead and give P5 a shot at the

                        >P5 Getting Started Guide</a
                    >. The tutorials are excellent and, like Sketchingpy, there
                    is a web editor available.

                <h2>JavaScript Itself</h2>

                <div>
                    P5 offers a great introduction into JavaScript because the
                    "way of thinking" about computation can translate well
                    between P5, Processing, Sketchingpy, and many other similar
                    libraries. Let's next compare some of the language features
                    of Python and JavaScript by reviewing
                    <a

                        >Learning Javascript as a Python Developer</a
                    >. This just runs through some of the things you might
                    notice as different when you get started using JS in your
                    work.

            <section id="d3">
                <h2>D3</h2>

                <div>
                    P5 can do some incredible stuff but
                    <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> is also
                    commonly used for data visualization in JavaScript. The way
                    that D3 thinks about data and drawing is a bit different
                    than P5. Specifically, while P5 fits into a procedural or
                    object oriented paradigm, D3 focuses quite a bit on a
                    "functional programming" perspective. For this next section,
                    you may consider using
                    <a href="https://observablehq.com/" target="_blank"
                        >Observable</a
                    >
                    or
                    <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a> if
                    you have not done much web development before. Regardless,
                    make your way through a
                    <a
                        href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/d3js-tutorial-data-visualization-for-beginners/"

                        >D3 tutorial</a
                    >. If you can master D3, P5, and Sketchingpy, you really can
                    take your data visualizations anywhere.

                That's it! In general, I still recommend most students use
                Python (and possibly Sketchingpy) for the last part of the
                class. This skills lab just gives you a sense of what the JS
                avenue looks like so that you are better positioned to make that
                jump into JS later. However, if you feel comfortable with web
                development maybe because you have had prior experience in HTML
                / CSS / JS, feel free to give that a shot for this class'
                concluding project. Regardless, thank you for being such an
                excellent group of students. Thanks so much for a fantastic
                class. I can't wait to see you for your final projects.
