  We've explored data visualization concepts in the general sense so
  the lessons learned from this class can go with you regardless of
  what technology (including pen and paper!) you use to realize your
  ideas. Today we will explore JavaScript (sometimes called ECMAScript
  or just JS) as another option. Note that this skills lab is
  optional.

        There are a lot of technologies out there to make data
        visualizations. Some like
        <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau</a>
        don't require code. Others like
        <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega</a> are
        programming languages just for data visualization. The
        concepts we've explored in this class translate across all
        of these different options and, indeed, many use similar
        teminology to that which we've explored together in class.
        This means that, even if you are moving into a new
        technology, you should see some familiar ideas.

        Even so, note that we've often centered our discussion on
        Sketchingpy which has given us an opportunity to program for
        the web through Python. This language was used as this
        technology is more commonly known amoung the students
        participating this semester. It is also one of the more
        frequently used languages in the scientific computing space.

        While professional data visualization designers use Python,
        our community also uses other languages as well. In
        particular, JavaScript is a popular option as it also runs
        within the browser. We will explore JavaScript here. The
        good news is Skechingpy is similar to some JavaScript
        libraries leveraged for interactive data graphics so the
        transition isn't too hard.

        <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">P5</a> is the
        JavaScript equivalent to
        <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, one of the
        libraries that really blew open the doors to interactive
        data graphics. Also, working with P5 isn't too dissimilar to
        working with Sketchingpy. Go ahead and give P5 a shot at the

        is a web editor available.

        P5 offers a great introduction into JavaScript because the
        "way of thinking" about computation can translate well
        between P5, Processing, Sketchingpy, and many other similar
        libraries. Let's next compare some of the language features
        of Python and JavaScript by reviewing

        notice as different when you get started using JS in your
        work.

        P5 can do some incredible stuff but
        <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> is also
        commonly used for data visualization in JavaScript. The way
        that D3 thinks about data and drawing is a bit different
        than P5. Specifically, while P5 fits into a procedural or
        object oriented paradigm, D3 focuses quite a bit on a
        "functional programming" perspective. For this next section,
        you may consider using
        <a href="https://observablehq.com/" target="_blank"
          >Observable</a
        >
        or
        <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a> if
        you have not done much web development before. Regardless,
        make your way through a

        take your data visualizations anywhere.

      That's it! In general, I still recommend most students use
      Python (and possibly Sketchingpy) for the last part of the
      class. This skills lab just gives you a sense of what the JS
      avenue looks like so that you are better positioned to make that
      jump into JS later. However, if you feel comfortable with web
      development maybe because you have had prior experience in HTML
      / CSS / JS, feel free to give that a shot for this class'
      concluding project. Regardless, thank you for being such an
      excellent group of students. Thanks so much for a fantastic
      class. I can't wait to see you for your final projects.
