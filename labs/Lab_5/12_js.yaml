  We've explored data visualization concepts in the general sense so
  the lessons learned from this class can go with you regardless of
  what technology (including pen and paper!) you use to realize your
  ideas. Today we will explore JavaScript (sometimes called ECMAScript
  or just JS) as another option. Note that this skills lab is
  optional.

    short: Motivation
    long: Why learn JavaScript for data visualization?
    markdown: |
      There are a lot of technologies out there to make data visualizations. Some like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) don't require code. Others like [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) are programming languages just for data visualization. The concepts we've explored in this class translate across all of these different options and, indeed, many use similar teminology to that which we've explored together in class. This means that, even if you are moving into a new technology, you should see some familiar ideas.

      Even so, note that we've often centered our discussion on Sketchingpy which has given us an opportunity to program for the web through Python. This language was used as this technology is more commonly known amoung the students participating this semester. It is also one of the more frequently used languages in the scientific computing space.

      While professional data visualization designers use Python, our community also uses other languages as well. In particular, JavaScript is a popular option as it also runs within the browser. We will explore JavaScript here. The good news is Skechingpy is similar to some JavaScript libraries leveraged for interactive data graphics so the transition isn't too hard.
  - name: p5
    short: P5
    long: P5.js for creative coding
    markdown: |
      [P5](https://p5js.org/) is the JavaScript equivalent to [Processing](https://processing.org/), one of the libraries that really blew open the doors to interactive data graphics. Also, working with P5 isn't too dissimilar to working with Sketchingpy. Go ahead and give P5 a shot at the [P5 Getting Started Guide](https://p5js.org/tutorials/get-started/). The tutorials are excellent and, like Sketchingpy, there is a web editor available.
  - name: javascript-itself
    short: JavaScript Itself
    long: Learning JavaScript as a Python developer
    markdown: |
      P5 offers a great introduction into JavaScript because the "way of thinking" about computation can translate well between P5, Processing, Sketchingpy, and many other similar libraries. Let's next compare some of the language features of Python and JavaScript by reviewing [Learning Javascript as a Python Developer](https://dev.to/kachiic/learning-javascript-as-a-python-developer-126g). This just runs through some of the things you might notice as different when you get started using JS in your work.
  - name: d3
    short: D3
    long: D3.js for data-driven documents
    markdown: |
      P5 can do some incredible stuff but [D3](https://d3js.org/) is also commonly used for data visualization in JavaScript. The way that D3 thinks about data and drawing is a bit different than P5. Specifically, while P5 fits into a procedural or object oriented paradigm, D3 focuses quite a bit on a "functional programming" perspective. For this next section, you may consider using [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) if you have not done much web development before. Regardless, make your way through a [D3 tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/d3js-tutorial-data-visualization-for-beginners/). If you can master D3, P5, and Sketchingpy, you really can take your data visualizations anywhere.

      That's it! In general, I still recommend most students use
      Python (and possibly Sketchingpy) for the last part of the
      class. This skills lab just gives you a sense of what the JS
      avenue looks like so that you are better positioned to make that
      jump into JS later. However, if you feel comfortable with web
      development maybe because you have had prior experience in HTML
      / CSS / JS, feel free to give that a shot for this class'
      concluding project. Regardless, thank you for being such an
      excellent group of students. Thanks so much for a fantastic
      class. I can't wait to see you for your final projects.
