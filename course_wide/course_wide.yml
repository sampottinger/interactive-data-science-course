sections:
  - name: Hello
    number: 1
    tagline: Begin with an initial exploration of key ideas.
    detailed: >
      We start our journey together by motivating why data visualization is useful, what
      interactive science can offer, and take an early look at some of the foundational ideas that we
      will explore together throughout the rest of the course. We will also make sure everyone has
      what they need to do some upcoming activities with two optional skills labs.

  - name: Primitives
    number: 2
    tagline: Study of the essential building blocks for data visualization.
    detailed: >
      We transition to the foundational building blocks of data visualization and explore the
      cognitive science underpinnings behind effective information design. Using what many call the
      grammar of graphics, we will also have our first small projects that begin to offer hands-on
      experiences to build custom graphics with code.

  - name: Combination
    number: 3
    tagline: Understand common patterns and methods for making new ones.
    detailed: >
      Having built up the primitives used in data visualization, we pick up the pace to build
      sophisticated data graphics. After using existing chart types, we venture into the great
      unknown by looking at how these lego pieces enable us to build completely new visual
      representations and how to test if novel approaches are successful.

  - name: Conversation
    number: 4
    tagline: Consider and design for the reader's dialogue with your work.
    detailed: >
      Just short of half way through the course, you are already an expert at choosing from existing
      chart types and constructing your own novel visual representations. Next we look critically at
      the role of the reader to construct media which enable the reader to explore more freely and
      become a co-creator of knowledge.

  - name: Context
    number: 5
    tagline: Expand our understanding of the reader.
    detailed: >
      Now that we have a deeper understanding of how to think about the reader within our designs,
      we next zoom out to understand users as within a broader social and physical context. We will
      also consider visualization in a broader sense-making context.

  - name: Skills
    number: 6
    tagline: Grow your implementation tool chest.
    detailed: >
      You have gotten through some of the most important concepts in data visualization and
      interactive science. Now, we will explore different technical skills as you work on your final
      project. Note that guest lectures may move.

  - name: Build
    number: 7
    tagline: Contribute to your portfolio.
    detailed: >
      The course ends with sharing final projects and a celebration of our time together.
