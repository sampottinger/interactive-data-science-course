# Code Projects Rubric

Across the course, you will be asked to submit code for 7 regular assignments and the final project. This rubric describes how these exercises are scored for our for-credit students. As we gain more skills, we can add more criteria to our rubric until reaching the final! There are 4 categories of criteria with the weighting below. Each individual criterion is worth one point within its category. All that said, you don't need to worry too much about the specifics here (unless you want to). The goal of this rubric really is to help me (Sam) structure feedback, provide ideas to keep in mind as you build your work, and help you understand what I will be looking for as we go through. Note that, for these assignments, please talk to me (Sam) before using a technology other than Python / Sketchingpy. Thanks!

## Category Weights

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Completeness | 30% |
| Materials / Concepts | 30% |

## Notes

- Each criterion within a category is worth one point.
- Criteria accumulate as the course progresses - once a criterion is introduced, it continues to apply in subsequent assignments.
- The checkmark (✓) indicates when each criterion first becomes part of the rubric.
