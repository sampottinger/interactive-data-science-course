  Consider essential empirical evidence regarding encoding devices
  from Cleveland and McGill. Also, examine important techniques that
  allow us to re-use high value encoding devices. Specifically, learn
  more about dual axes, shared axes, and direct labeling.
assignment: >
  <p>
    We have a fantastic opportunity to apply recent class concepts
    through an exploration of US Census American Community Survey
    (2024) results.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>: We will be working with a dataset
    derived from US Census data. Though originally designed for use in
    understanding "income gaps" between different groups of people, it
    can also be used to explore other questions about economics and
    work. It can explore differing levels of participation in
    different occupations, unemployment rates, and regional trends.
    There are a lot of variables to explore! This project will provide
    a space to experiment with encoding devices, data density,
    preattentive features, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Objective</strong>: Please visualize a subset of variables
    from this dataset. If using shared axes, please have a clear "main
    plot" from which those axes are shared. For this assignment,
    please include 4 or more variables. For example, you could
    visualize unemployment and wage (2 variables) by age and gender (2
    variables). This would be a total of 4 variables (unemployment,
    wage, age, gender).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data</strong>: You may use the

    <a href="https://microdata.epi.org">
      EPI Microdata Extracts
    </a>

    directly but I recommend using the Income Gaps CSV instead to
    focus your time on the visual elements of this project. If you are
    using the

    <a href="https://incomegaps.com/data.csv">
      Income Gaps CSV file
    </a>,

    I also recommend using

    <a
    href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps/blob/main/preprocess/data_model.py">
      data_model.py
    </a> as described in the

    <a
    href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps?tab=readme-ov-file#data">
      Income Gaps CSV documentation
    </a>.

    If using the online editor for Sketchingpy, just download

    <a
    href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps/blob/main/preprocess/data_model.py">
      data_model.py
    </a>

    and add it to your sketchbook.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tech</strong>: Though you may be able to complete
    Assignment 9 using prebuilt charts like through Matplotlib, you
    may find it more difficult to continue using it for later
    exercises where detailed control over each element of your graphic
    will be essential. Therefore, I recommend using Python and
    Sketchingpy. To help, see also
