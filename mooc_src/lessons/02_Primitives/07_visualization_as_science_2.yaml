  Tour the Gestalt Principles and engage in a hands-on activity to put
  them into practice. Afterwards, explore color vision including color
  spaces, perceptually consistent color schemes, tools for color, and
  general guidance.

  <p>
    Return to your Job Satisfaction exercise. Make a new graphic that
    displays the same variables but use a different visual
    representation. For example, if you previously chose a scatter
    plot, try a heatmap or bar chart. It doesn't necessarily need to
    be better or worse. It just needs to be different.
  </p>
  <p>
    When done, write 3 - 4 sentences about how your plot uses
    pre-attentive variables. Use this as a chance to reflect on how it
    felt to explore alternative options.
