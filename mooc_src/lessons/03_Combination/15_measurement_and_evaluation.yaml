  I would love to share <a href="https://youtu.be/-FT3qmJEvs0">a talk
  from Jane Fulton Suri</a>. Sorry the screen isn't visible but it's
  an excellent follow up to today and also one of the only recordings
  available of it. The hospital example involved a camera basically
  fixed to a patient's head which revealed that their day is spent
  looking up at the ceiling with people looking down at them.
