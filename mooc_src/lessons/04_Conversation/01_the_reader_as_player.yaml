  Go deep into interactivity with affordances, kinesthetic projection,
  and common patterns in data visualization. This is setting up our
  final ingredient for data visualizations that you need for the
  final!
assignment: >
  <p>
    We will start our interactive experience. There are different
    video games for you to choose from within the <a
    href="/course_wide/manual.html">course manual</a>. See
    "experience" section. After you have selected your choice, lookup
    the <a href="/support/misc/games.pdf">game specific
    instructions</a>. You can space out your game play over the next
    few lectures. There will be an additional question asked of all
    games later in <a href="/lesson20.html">lesson 20</a> when it
    would be good to be done.
