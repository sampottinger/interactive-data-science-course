  A detailed overview of the course which introduces central concepts,
  what you will learn, and what we will be doing together.
  Specifically, we look at 4 different perspectives on data
  visualization in order to paint a landscape of ideas that will be
  revisited and expanded upon throughout the rest of our time together.

    We will learn more about how tools change the way we think. Please
    watch the very excellent <a
    href="https://vimeo.com/67076984">Media for Thinking the
    Unthinkable lecture</a> delivered by Bret Victor at the MIT Media
    Lab. A question for you to consider is what kinds of
    representations of thought do you use every day?

    Again, just a reminder that <a href="/#materials">central course
    materials</a> are available which include the course manual,
    syllabus, and grading rubric.
