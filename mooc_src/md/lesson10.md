# Lesson 10
Sketching with data.

## Objective
Apply coding skills with data. Builds on previous lessons in creative coding and visual representation through completion of Skills Lab 4, particularly Tutorial 11 on data resources.

## Outline
This lecture focuses on practical application of coding skills with data. Building on previous lessons (Lectures 8 and 9) on sketching in code, this lesson adds the crucial element of working with actual data and prepares students for upcoming lessons on formalizing glyphs and empirical evidence regarding encoding devices.

### Data integration in creative coding
Students learn to work with data in code using Sketchingpy and apply visual encoding principles to data-driven graphics.

  - Loading and processing data in code.
  - Applying visual encoding principles to data.
  - Creating data-driven visualizations from scratch.

### Skills Lab 4
Students complete the remaining tutorials in Skills Lab 4, with special emphasis on Tutorial 11.

  - Tutorial 11 covers working with data resources.
  - Practice skills from Skills Lab 4.
  - Use Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook for hands-on practice.

### Preparation for visual acuity
Mention of the reading assignment introducing William Cleveland's work.

  - Prepares students for upcoming lessons on formalizing glyphs.
  - Introduces empirical evidence regarding encoding devices.
  - Begins foundation for visual acuity discussions.

## Take Aways
This lesson continues the Primitives section of the course, where students learn about perception and cognitive science principles for visualization using Sketchingpy and Matplotlib.

  - Work with data in code using Sketchingpy.
  - Apply previous lessons on visual encoding to data-driven graphics.
  - Complete Tutorial 11 on data resources.
  - Read about William Cleveland's contributions to data visualization science.
