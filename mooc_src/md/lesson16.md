# Lesson 16: The Reader as User

## Objective
Explore different conceptual frameworks for understanding the role of the user in data visualization, moving from mechanical interaction to co-creation of meaning.

## Outline
This lecture explores the relationship between author and audience through multiple lenses. Understanding different ways of thinking about the role of the user provides perspectives that can be used to understand design. Seeing visualizations from multiple perspectives helps pieces be more successful.

### Audiences: Interrogating our lenses
The relationship between author and audience is mediated by the visualization itself.

  - The author makes choices about assumptions, focus, and language.
  - Stuart Hall's Reception Theory describes three ways audiences interpret media:
    - Dominant reading: accepting the intended message as presented.
    - Oppositional reading: rejecting the intended message entirely.
    - Negotiated reading: partially accepting and partially rejecting the message.
  - Students examined "How Covid Shook the US: Eight Charts That Capture the Last Two Years" from The Guardian through these three reading positions.

### Wave 1: Ergonomics
The user as a robot interpreting through a mechanical system.

  - Focus on physical interaction and ergonomic design.
  - Understanding how users mechanically interact with interfaces.
  - Examples include airplane cockpit design and door affordances.
  - Emphasis on making clear how a data visualization should be used.
  - Fine-tuning mechanisms through which a person "mechanically" interacts.
  - Example: fuel efficiency standards visualization showing data from 1978 to 1985.

### Wave 2: Information and dialogue
The user as engaged in conversation with a series of questions completing a task.

  - Focus on information exchange and task completion.
  - User flows and supporting series of questions or tasks.
  - Multiple coordinated views and interactive exploration.
  - Examples include Windows 98 installation interface, Asana project management, and podcast visualization.
  - Think about the flow of a user (user loops).
  - Support a series of questions or tasks.
  - Enable dialogue between user and system.

### Wave 3: Context
The user as an entity with thought interpreting work through personal and cultural lenses within a social system.

  - Recognition that users exist within social and cultural contexts.
  - Understanding how context interacts with the visualization.
  - Examples include Global Plastics AI Policy Tool.
  - Critically interrogating the context and how it may interact with the graphic.
  - Understanding users as thinking beings embedded in cultural and social systems, not just task-completing entities.

### Media for thought
Using mathematical notation and visual representations as tools for thinking.

  - Historical example from Arabic mathematics demonstrates how notation itself shapes what we can think about.
  - Ancient mathematical problem about finding a square shows how mathematical notation (x² + 10x = 39) provides a more efficient medium for mathematical thought than prose description.
  - Interactive visualizations can serve as dynamic media for thought.
  - Allow users to explore mathematical and data-driven concepts.

### Games: The user as co-creator
Games represent a co-created experience between the player and the technology or designer.

  - Reference: Jesse Schell's "The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses".
  - Users as co-creators of meaning.
  - The work as a way to think new thoughts.
  - Creation of sometimes uniquely individual experiences.
  - Spaces that can be activated by users to see, feel, do, and think new things.
  - Will Wright describes how games enable players to build narratives and experiences that go beyond the designer's original intention.

## Take Aways
Understanding these different conceptualizations of the user suggests designers should consider multiple perspectives when creating data visualizations.

  - Make it clear how a data visualization should be used and fine-tune the mechanisms through which a person "mechanically" interacts (Wave 1).
  - Think about the flow of a user (user loops) and how we support a series of questions or tasks (Wave 2).
  - Critically interrogate the context of this visualization and how it may interact with the graphic (Wave 3).
  - Create spaces that can be activated by the user to see, feel, do, and think new things (Games and Media for Thought).
  - The user can be conceptualized as: a robot interpreting through a mechanical system, a conversational partner completing tasks, an entity with thought within a social system, or a co-creator of meaning.
