# Lesson 15
Briefly introducing design research methods.

## Objective
Introduce accessible design research techniques for understanding users and evaluating data visualizations, with focus on practical methods including user interviews, contextual inquiry, the Think-Aloud Protocol, and co-design.

## Outline
This lecture provides an introduction to design research methods for learning from users. It starts with theoretical underpinnings before covering four primary research methods, offering practical guidance for each technique and emphasizing the Think-Aloud Protocol as an accessible tool for visualization measurement and evaluation.

### Why design research
Understanding the user is essential to answering critical design questions.

  - What are the right questions to ask within a data visualization?
  - What are the most important variables to include?
  - How should we prioritize encoding devices?
  - This is not a comprehensive course on user research methods in human-centered design.
  - The goal is to provide a sense of how design research is done and introduce one specific tool useful for visualization measurement and evaluation.
  - Employing these techniques may involve ethical considerations and training depending on the circumstance.

### Theoretical underpinnings
Before evaluating applied methods, consider these theoretical perspectives.

  - We observe the world through a cultural and experiential lens, including how we interpret visualizations (diagrammatic thinking).
  - The question is whether we can, without judgment, learn about the experiences of others (design empathy).
  - Design research centers outside and often lived expertise to understand experiences and how symbols (including objects) get meaning within those experiences and social systems (symbolic interactionism).

### Design research evolution
According to Jane Fulton Suri (IDEO), various approaches came together into comprehensive methodology.

  - In the design of physical products, the goal was to create an object that effectively signaled its function to the user.
  - Other designers focused on the meaning people placed on artifacts, rituals, and behaviors and how to incorporate those interactions into their work.
  - In Scandinavia, designers began including the end user in the process early on, focusing on co-creation.
  - As human-centered design became more defined, these various approaches came together into a more comprehensive methodology.

### User interviews
User interviews may be used in learning about a product, population, system, process, etc.

  - Leave it open ended and follow them.
  - Ask open-ended questions which allow the user to guide you to new topics.
  - Who, what, when, where, and why are all helpful, but why, who, and how can be particularly generative.
  - Ask about specific and, when possible, recent actual events.
  - Example questions: Why are those goals important? Who works with you on those goals? How did those deadlines get set? Can you describe your day yesterday? What did you feel going through that process?
  - Interview techniques: echoing, silence, interesting redirect, advice to someone else, advice to past self, end with magic wand.
  - Things to avoid: dead ends, judgment, leading questions, double-barrel questions.

### Contextual inquiry
Contextual inquiry is similar to a user interview but conducted in action.

  - The goal is to observe a specific situated experience.
  - The primary goal is to observe and ask non-disruptive questions.
  - Best when conducted in the course of regular activity.
  - Approach with a beginner's mind and without judgment.

### Think-Aloud Protocol
The Think-Aloud Protocol is one of the easiest methods for observing how users interact with visualizations.

  - Provide users with a simple prompt: "Please go through this tutorial and while doing so, please try your best to think aloud."
  - Users verbalize their thought process as they interact with the visualization.
  - Reveals what they notice first, what confuses them, what assumptions they make, where they get stuck, and what they find intuitive or difficult.
  - Well-established in HCI research through work by Ben Shneiderman and Catherine Plaisant as well as Clayton Lewis and John Rieman.
  - The multi-dimensional aspect refers to using observations, interviews, surveys, as well as automated logging to assess user performance and interface efficacy and utility.

### Co-design
Co-design breaks down the distinction between users and designers.

  - Instead of treating people as users, invite them in as partners.
  - Allow others to fundamentally guide the process in conceptualization and design.
  - Often works well when you can make a long-term repeated relationship.
  - Can be effective for more involved feedback, especially for expert tools.

## Take Aways
Design research provides essential methods for understanding users and improving data visualizations through their feedback and participation.

  - Understanding the user is essential for making critical design decisions about visualizations.
  - User interviews use open-ended questions to learn about products, populations, systems, and processes.
  - Contextual inquiry observes users in action during regular activity.
  - The Think-Aloud Protocol is an accessible method for visualization evaluation where users verbalize their thought process.
  - Co-design invites users as partners to fundamentally guide the design process.
  - These techniques require approaching users with empathy, a beginner's mind, and without judgment.
