# Lesson 4
Briefly introducing custom objects for creative coding.

## Objective
Apply object-oriented programming to create interactive graphical simulations through hands-on practice with custom objects.

## Outline
This skills lab session uses a flipped classroom model where students work through Tutorial 3 at their own pace. Tutorial 3 ties together concepts from the first skills lab, exploring custom objects for creative coding.

### Tutorial 3 focus
Complete Tutorial 3 which integrates foundational Python skills with creative coding techniques.

- Object-oriented programming in the context of creative coding.
- Creating and managing custom objects for visual elements.
- Building interactive graphical simulations.
- Connecting concepts from Skills Lab 1 with new techniques.

### Flipped classroom approach
Students work independently with support channels available.

- Work through tutorial materials at their own pace.
- Access support through various help channels including peer review.
- Receive assistance from instructors during lab time.
- Practice using the Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook.

### Assignment
Revisit the visualization from the last exercise and analyze it through the 4 perspectives.

- What visual encoding devices are used?
- What task or user journey is being accomplished through the piece?
- Does the piece try to also convey an emotion and, if so, how?
- Does the piece invite the reader to reach their own conclusions about the data and, if so, how?
- Please write 4 to 8 sentences.

### Reading
Review Edward Tufte's continuing influence on modern data visualization.

- Read the review of Tufte from LeRoy examining The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.
- Available at benjaminleroy.github.io.

## Take Aways
Object-oriented programming enables more sophisticated and maintainable interactive visualizations by organizing code into reusable custom objects.

- Tutorial 3 ties together concepts from the first skills lab.
- Custom objects model visual elements and their behaviors.
- Flipped classroom allows self-paced learning with support.
- Access tutorials at interactivedatascience.courses/labs.
- Practice with the Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook at editor.sketchingpy.org.
