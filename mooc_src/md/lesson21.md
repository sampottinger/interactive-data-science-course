# Lecture 21: Thinking Toys and Diegesis

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** April 14, 2025

## Description

A deeper look at building explorable explorations and the idea of thinking toys / diegesis. This lecture examines how interactive visualizations can become media for thought, allowing users to explore data beyond prescribed narratives and create meaning as co-authors.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture introduces the concept of "media for thought" - interactive experiences that serve as tools for exploration and discovery rather than just presentation.

- **Media for Thought**: Interactive visualizations designed to help users think, explore, and discover insights beyond what the designer explicitly encoded.
- **Explorable Explanations**: Interactive pieces where readers can manipulate parameters and see results in real-time, becoming active participants in understanding concepts.
- **Thinking Toys**: Tools that afford exploration and experimentation, allowing users to test hypotheses and build intuition.
- **Diegetic Elements**: Interface elements that exist within the world of the visualization itself, making controls feel natural and integrated rather than external.
- **Possibility Space**: The range of actions and explorations available to users within an interactive experience.

## Historical Context and Key Thinkers

The lecture traces the intellectual journey of media for thought:

### Donald Bitzer and the PLATO System

- Pioneered early interactive educational computing
- Created systems that allowed dynamic exploration of concepts
- Demonstrated how computers could be tools for thinking, not just calculation

### Kenneth Iverson

- Authored "Notation as a Tool of Thought" (1980)
- Argued that the notation we use shapes what we can think
- Mathematical notation provides a well-developed example of language as a tool of thought
- Demonstrated how notation can make advanced problems more tractable and increase mental power
- "Notation as a tool of thought"

### Bret Victor

- Created "Explorable Explanations" (2011) manifesto
- Developed "Stop Drawing Dead Fish" talk (2012)
- Advocates for dynamic, interactive representations
- Active Reading: Readers should be able to ask questions, consider alternatives, question assumptions, and test the author's claims
- Traditional reading environments (books, websites) display only the author's argument
- The reader's line of thought remains internal, invisible, and speculative
- Interactive media can externalize and make concrete the reader's exploration
- Move from passive consumption to active investigation

### Maggie Appleton

- Focuses on "Tools for Thought as Cultural Practices, not Computational Objects"
- Explores programming portals and learnable programming
- Advocates for intertwining graphical representations with programming
- Programming systems should be open-ended and flexible
- Visual interfaces shouldn't replace syntax entirely

### Nicky Case

- Creator of explorable explanations and interactive pieces
- Parable of the Polygons: Interactive exploration of how small individual biases can lead to large collective segregation
- Evolution of Trust: Game theory exploration through interactive simulation
- Creates pieces where users discover insights through play and experimentation rather than being told conclusions.

## Design Principles for Media for Thought

1. Assume the User is a Co-Creator of Meaning

- Don't prescribe a single interpretation
- Provide tools for users to explore their own questions
- Support multiple pathways through the material
- Enable users to construct their own understanding

2. Create Space for Exploration Outside Your Narrative

- Go beyond the "ghost train ride" model (prescribed path)
- Move toward "open world" experiences
- Allow users to test hypotheses you didn't anticipate
- Support serendipitous discovery

3. Offer Meaningful Controls Within Clear Possibility Spaces

- Define what users can manipulate
- Ensure controls have meaningful, understandable effects
- Provide clear feedback loops (user loops)
- Balance freedom with comprehensibility

## Diegetic Elements vs. Possibility Space

**Diegetic Elements**: Interface elements that exist within the world of the visualization itself. These controls feel natural and integrated because they're part of the visualization's context. For example, in a planetary orbit simulator, a slider labeled "Orbit Speed" that appears as part of the control panel within the simulation interface, styled to match the aesthetic of the space environment.

**Possibility Space**: The abstract range of what users can do within the experience. This defines the boundaries of exploration. Imagine a diagram showing a ball with an arrow indicating it can move freely within a defined rectangular boundary - representing constrained but meaningful freedom. Challenge is to create enough freedom for genuine exploration while maintaining coherence and preventing users from getting lost.

## Group Activity: Exploring Explorables

Students were asked to:

1. Visit https://explorabl.es
2. Find an explorable explanation
3. Identify the user loop(s)
4. Analyze what the user loop adds that a static equivalent would not have

This activity helps students:

- Experience diverse approaches to explorable explanations
- Understand how interactivity transforms comprehension
- Identify effective design patterns
- Consider the value-add of interaction over static presentation

## Connection to Data Visualization
In reconnecting to traditional information design...

### From Presentation to Exploration

Traditional data visualizations often function as arguments in that the designer has a message to convey. Media for thought approaches visualization differently, giving users agency over messages derived (co-created with tool).

### Applications in Data Visualization

1. **Policy Exploration Tools**: Allow stakeholders to test different scenarios and see projected outcomes
2. **Data Dashboards**: Enable users to filter, aggregate, and view data from multiple perspectives
3. **Simulation Tools**: Let users adjust parameters and observe system behavior
4. **Educational Visualizations**: Help learners build intuition through experimentation

### Examples from Course

Several tools shown throughout the course exemplify this approach:
- Global Plastics AI Policy Tool
- En-ROADS Climate Simulator
- Income Gaps explorer
- Parable of the Polygons

## Implications for Interactive Design
In thinking about interaction design...

### User Agency

Media for thought elevates users from consumers to co-authors. This requires:

- Respecting user intelligence and curiosity
- Providing genuine agency, not just the illusion of control
- Supporting diverse exploration paths
- Accepting that users may reach different conclusions

### Mental Models

Users need to understand:

- What they can manipulate
- What the controls represent
- How changes affect outcomes
- The boundaries of the system

### Feedback Loops

Effective media for thought requires tight feedback loops:

- Immediate response to user actions
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships
- Visual or textual confirmation of changes
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
