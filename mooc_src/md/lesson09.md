# Lesson 9: Skills Lab 4
Briefly sketching with code continued.

## Objective
Continue exploration of creative coding with Python by integrating text, images, data, and user interaction into code-based visualizations.

## Outline
Building on the foundational concepts from Sketching in Code 1, this lecture focuses on integrating multiple modalities into data visualizations and adding interactivity to engage users. We bridge the gap between static visualizations and interactive experiences.

### Adding text to visualizations
Text serves as a critical component of data visualization, providing labels, annotations, context, and explanation.

  - Font selection and typography
  - Text positioning and alignment
  - Readability and legibility
  - Text as a visual element (glyphs)

### Working with images
Incorporating images into sketches expands creative possibilities.

  - Loading and displaying image files
  - Image manipulation and transformation
  - Using images as data sources
  - Combining images with generative graphics

### Data integration
Moving from abstract graphics to data-driven visualizations.

  - Loading data from files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
  - Parsing and processing data structures
  - Mapping data values to visual properties
  - Creating dynamic visualizations from datasets

### User interaction fundamentals
Introduction to interactive programming with event-driven concepts.

  - Event-driven programming concepts
  - Mouse and keyboard input
  - State management in interactive sketches
  - Feedback mechanisms for user actions

### Considerations for interactivity
When designing interaction, focus on one primary user action at a time and ensure interactions respond meaningfully to their context.

  - Single actions: Click, hover, drag, or keypress
  - Visual feedback that relates to the interaction
  - State changes that reflect user intent
  - Progressive disclosure of information
  - Balancing complexity with usability

### Skills Lab 3
This lecture primarily consists of hands-on tutorials rather than traditional slides.

  - Tutorial 11 covers working with text in Sketchingpy
  - Incorporating images into your sketches
  - Loading and visualizing data
  - Creating basic interactions
  - Sketchingpy Online Editor available at https://editor.sketchingpy.org/

### Assignment
For this follow-up exercise, add interactivity to your creative coding project from the previous lesson.

  - Add interaction that uses only a single action or verb like hover or click
  - Action could be contextualized like the rotating color wheels example from Skills Lab 4
  - Explore how your work can respond to a simple user action

### Building on previous concepts
This lecture builds directly on concepts from earlier in the course.

  - Gestalt principles (Lecture 7): Apply proximity, similarity, and continuity to guide users through interactive experiences
  - Pre-attentive features (Lectures 6-7): Use color, motion, and position to draw attention to interactive elements and provide feedback
  - Visual encoding (Lectures 1, 5): Continue using effective encoding devices while adding the dimension of interaction

### Connections to data visualization perspectives
Adding these elements continues our exploration of multiple perspectives on data visualization.

  - Data visualization as representation: How information becomes visible through code
  - Data visualization as task: Interactive elements support user tasks by allowing exploration and manipulation of data
  - Data visualization as message: Text and images enhance storytelling capabilities, while interaction can guide readers through a narrative
  - Data visualization as dialogue: User interaction begins the transition from passive viewing to active participation in the visualization experience

## Take Aways
Text, images, data, and user interaction transform static visualizations into dynamic, engaging experiences that support exploration and storytelling.

  - Text provides essential context and can serve as a visual design element
  - Images expand creative possibilities and can be used as data sources
  - Data integration enables creating visualizations that respond to real-world information
  - Simple single-action interactions create meaningful user engagement
  - Interactive design builds on Gestalt principles and pre-attentive features
  - Event-driven programming patterns enable responsive, stateful visualizations
