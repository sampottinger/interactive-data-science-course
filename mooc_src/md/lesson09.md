# Lecture 9: Sketching in Code 2

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** February 24, 2025

## Description

Looking at the other elements we can bring into our work: text, images, data, and the user. This lecture continues the exploration of creative coding with Python, building on the foundational concepts from Sketching in Code 1. The focus is on integrating multiple modalities into data visualizations and adding interactivity to engage users.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture bridges the gap between static visualizations and interactive experiences by introducing how to incorporate various media types and user interactions into your code-based sketches.

### Core Elements
- **Text**: Typography and text rendering in visualizations
- **Images**: Incorporating visual assets into sketches
- **Data**: Loading and working with datasets programmatically
- **User Interaction**: Responding to user input and creating dynamic experiences

### Interactive Design Principles
Building on Gestalt Principles and Pre-attentive Features from previous lectures, this session focuses on:
- Single action interactions (hover, click)
- Contextual responses to user input
- Creating engaging, responsive visualizations

## Content Outline
We continue building on the foundation from the previous skills labs.

### Adding Text to Visualizations
Text serves as a critical component of data visualization, providing:

- Labels and annotations
- Context and explanation

Key considerations for text in code:

- Font selection and typography
- Text positioning and alignment
- Readability and legibility
- Text as a visual element (glyphs)

### Working with Images
Incorporating images into sketches expands creative possibilities:

- Loading and displaying image files
- Image manipulation and transformation
- Using images as data sources
- Combining images with generative graphics

### Data Integration
Moving from abstract graphics to data-driven visualizations:

- Loading data from files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Parsing and processing data structures
- Mapping data values to visual properties
- Creating dynamic visualizations from datasets

### User Interaction Fundamentals
Introduction to interactive programming:

- Event-driven programming concepts
- Mouse and keyboard input
- State management in interactive sketches
- Feedback mechanisms for user actions

## Activities
This lecture primarily consists of hands-on tutorials rather than traditional slides. Please refer to the Skills Lab materials for detailed instructions.

### Skills Lab 3
Complete the remaining tutorials under Skills Lab 3, which cover:
- Working with text in Sketchingpy
- Incorporating images into your sketches
- Loading and visualizing data
- Creating basic interactions

Access the tutorials at the [Skills Labs page](/labs).

### Sketchingpy Online Editor
Practice your skills using the [Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook](https://editor.sketchingpy.org/), which provides a browser-based environment for writing and testing code.

### Assignment
For this follow-up exercise, add interactivity to your creative coding project from the previous lesson. Specifically, add interaction that uses only a single action or verb like hover or click. This action could be contextualized like the rotating color wheels example from Skills Lab 4. However, the goal is to explore how your work can respond to a simple user action.

## Considerations for interactivity
When designing interaction, consider the following:

Focus on one primary user action at a time:

- **Click**: Triggering changes or revealing information
- **Hover**: Providing contextual feedback or highlighting
- **Drag**: Moving or manipulating visual elements
- **Keypress**: Using keyboard input for interaction

Interactions that respond meaningfully to their context:

- Visual feedback that relates to the interaction
- State changes that reflect user intent
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Layered complexity that builds on simple actions

Transitioning from fixed graphics to responsive experiences:

- Identifying opportunities for interaction
- Designing meaningful responses to user input
- Maintaining visual coherence during interaction
- Balancing complexity with usability

## Building on Previous Concepts

This lecture builds directly on concepts from earlier in the course:

### Gestalt Principles (Lecture 7)
Apply principles of proximity, similarity, and continuity to guide users through interactive experiences.

### Pre-attentive Features (Lectures 6-7)
Use color, motion, and position to draw attention to interactive elements and provide feedback.

### Visual Encoding (Lectures 1, 5)
Continue using effective encoding devices while adding the dimension of interaction.

## Technical Skills Development

### Skills Lab 3 Focus Areas
Tutorial 11 and related exercises cover:
1. **Text rendering**: Using text as both information and design element
2. **Image loading**: Working with external image files
3. **Data parsing**: Reading structured data files
4. **Basic interaction**: Responding to mouse and keyboard events
5. **State management**: Maintaining variables across frames

### Programming Patterns
Common patterns for interactive visualizations:
- Event handlers for user input
- Conditional rendering based on state
- Animation and transitions
- Data-driven updates

## Connections to Data Visualization Perspectives

### Data Visualization as Representation
Adding text, images, and data continues the exploration of how information becomes visible through code.

### Data Visualization as Task
Interactive elements support user tasks by allowing exploration and manipulation of data.

### Data Visualization as Message
Text and images enhance storytelling capabilities, while interaction can guide readers through a narrative.

### Data Visualization as Dialogue
User interaction begins the transition from passive viewing to active participation in the visualization experience.
