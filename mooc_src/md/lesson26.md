# Lesson 26
Expanding instruction to AI.

## Objective
Offer a hands-on exploration of using AI in constructing data visualizations through two LLM-focused labs.

## Outline
Added after Stat 198, a look at using generative AI in re-constructing an example data visualization from one of the early lectures of the course (predation / prey dynamics in Isle Royale).

### Since the original course
Since the original teaching of Stat 198, some things have changed but other aspects remain the same.

  - Generative AI has grown in popularity but so has resistance.
  - Some of the ethical considerations are outside the scope of this class but remain relevant.
  - Libraries like Sketchingpy have added llms.txt or similar to help aid use.
  - However, the rules and lessons haven’t really changed.

### New instruction
Lesson 26 goes beyond the original material of Stat 198 as an update to prior instruction. Specifically, new skills lab 6 offers two new tutorials.

  - Tutorial 13 looks at Matplotlib and re-generating the graphic we examined early in lecture.
  - Tutorial 14 expands this to Sketchingpy to provide a similar graphic.

### Role of AI
AI does not provide a silver bullet for understanding or visualizing data.

  - Limitations of language: it can be hard to describe what exactly Is desired.
  - Don’t forget the role of iteration.
    - Avoid offloading responsibility to AI.
    - Consider how AI can afford faster iteration.

## Take Aways
AI can help craft data visualizations but may serve more a role in accelerating implementation and less in design, especially as it can be difficult to describe in words what is desirable.

  - Explore if AI is right for you, it’s OK not to use it.
  - LLMs can provide a quick visualization.
  - Use tools like LLMs.txt to access libraries.
  - Remain vigilant in iteration and use LLMs to try more ideas faster.
