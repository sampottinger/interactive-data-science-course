# Lesson 25
Briefly applying skills in the final project.

## Objective
Synthesize all course concepts and skills to create a portfolio-quality capstone interactive data visualization project demonstrating mastery of representation, task, message, and dialogue perspectives.

## Outline
This final lesson focuses on applying everything learned throughout the course in a comprehensive final project, drawing from all four perspectives on data visualization while providing resources for advanced skill development through optional JavaScript tutorials.

### Course completion
Throughout this course, you have explored data visualization through multiple lenses.

  - Hello (Lectures 1-4): Introduction to the four perspectives and creative coding with Python.
  - Primitives (Lectures 5-11): Perception science, cognitive principles, Gestalt principles, color theory, pre-attentive features, and Cleveland and McGill's hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks.
  - Combination (Lectures 12-15): Common chart types, data formats, geospatial visualization, What/Why/How framework, and design research methods including user interviews and think-aloud protocols.
  - Conversation (Lectures 16-20): HCI paradigms, Stuart Hall's reception theory, game design concepts including affordances, kinesthetic projection, ludonarrative, environmental storytelling, and level design.
  - Context (Lectures 21-24): Thinking toys, diegesis, explorable explanations, accessibility standards (WCAG 2), ethics in data visualization, and inquiry-based design.

### Final project requirements
As outlined in the Course Manual, your final project should demonstrate comprehensive mastery of course concepts.

  - Demonstrate mastery of visual encoding principles.
  - Apply appropriate chart types and visualization patterns.
  - Incorporate user-centered design thinking.
  - Include meaningful interactivity that serves a purpose.
  - Consider accessibility from the start (WCAG 2 guidelines).
  - Address ethical considerations in data representation.
  - Tell a compelling story or enable users to find their own narratives.

### Technical implementation
You have multiple technology options for your final project.

  - Python with Sketchingpy: Great for custom visualizations with full control.
  - JavaScript with D3.js: Industry-standard library for web-based data visualization.
  - JavaScript with P5.js: Excellent for creative coding and interactive graphics.
  - Other technologies may be acceptable - consult the Course Manual.

### Design considerations
Consider how your final project incorporates elements from each perspective.

  - Data Visualization as Representation: Use appropriate visual encoding devices, consider the Cleveland and McGill hierarchy, leverage pre-attentive features, and ensure color schemes work for colorblind users.
  - Data Visualization as Task: Identify your user and their goals, consider the domain, determine what questions your visualization helps answer, and map the user's journey.
  - Data Visualization as Message: Tell a story with the data, consider how your visualization makes users feel, balance logos and pathos, and support or challenge user expectations.
  - Data Visualization as Dialogue: Provide agency for users to explore, enable users to find their own narratives, ensure interaction feels intuitive and purposeful, and apply level design principles for teaching users.

### Advanced skills
For those considering web technologies, optional JavaScript tutorial available.

  - Tutorial 12 introduces JavaScript for interactive data visualization.
  - Most interactive data visualizations on the web use JavaScript.
  - D3.js is the industry standard for data visualization.
  - P5.js offers powerful creative coding capabilities.
  - Web-based visualizations are easily shareable.

### Accessibility and ethics
Technical excellence must be paired with responsible design.

  - Color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.0 AA or AAA).
  - Keyboard navigation support.
  - Screen reader compatibility.
  - Alternative text for visual elements.
  - Consideration of who is represented and how.
  - Acknowledgment of data sources and limitations.
  - Awareness of potential biases in data or representation.

## Take Aways
This course has provided a comprehensive toolkit for creating meaningful, accessible, and impactful data visualizations by integrating perception science, user-centered design, narrative craft, and interaction design.

  - Apply comprehensive data visualization techniques learned throughout the course.
  - Create a portfolio-quality interactive data visualization project.
  - Integrate accessibility and ethical considerations into your work.
  - Showcase your ability to tell stories with data while empowering users to explore.
  - Skills extend beyond charts: communicate complex information visually, design for users with different needs, think critically about power and responsibility, create engaging interactive experiences, and bring together technical skills and design thinking.
