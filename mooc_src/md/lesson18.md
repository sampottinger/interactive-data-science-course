# Lecture 18: Ludonarrative

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** April 2, 2025

## Description

Examine the ideas of ludonarrative and environmental storytelling. This lecture explores how interaction creates narrative in data visualization and how game mechanics can serve as metaphor to convey meaning. The session includes multiple examples demonstrating how mechanics and narrative work together to create powerful interactive data experiences.

**Content Warning:** This lecture contains multiple content warnings and may contain mature material.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture explores how the mechanics of interaction themselves can tell stories and create meaning in data visualization.

### Core Concepts

**Ludonarrative**: From "ludo" (play/game) and "narrative" (story). It refers to the relationship between gameplay mechanics and the story or message being conveyed. In the context of data visualization, ludonarrative describes how the interactive mechanics and user actions themselves become part of the narrative being told.

**Mechanics as Metaphor**: The way users interact with data can reinforce, complement, or even contradict the intended message. When mechanics align with narrative, they create a more powerful and cohesive experience. The interaction patterns themselves become a vehicle for meaning-making.

**Environmental Storytelling**: Conveying narrative through spatial arrangement and design rather than explicit text. Information arranged in space can tell stories without words, allowing users to discover narrative by exploring and interacting with the data environment.

**Ludonarrative Harmony**: When mechanics and narrative align to create a cohesive message, creating powerful and meaningful experiences.

**Ludonarrative Dissonance**: When mechanics contradict or undermine the intended narrative, creating confusion or weakening the message.

## Introduction: Setting the Stage

The lecture begins with an interactive example to demonstrate the concept of how interaction creates narrative:

- URL: https://www.necessarygames.com/play/loneliness/?q=my-games/loneliness/flash
- A short game designed to convey emotion through mechanics
- Demonstrates how gameplay mechanics themselves tell a story
- Sets the foundation for understanding ludonarrative in data visualization

## Ludonarrative in Data Visualization

Understanding how game design principles apply to interactive data visualization helps create more meaningful and impactful experiences.

### Mechanics as Metaphor

Drawing from Extra Credits' "Mechanics as Metaphor" series, the lecture explores how the rules and interactions of a system can convey meaning beyond explicit narrative elements. In data visualization, this translates to:

- How users manipulate data reflects the message
- The effort required to interact with data can be meaningful
- Constraints on interaction can create narrative emphasis
- The relationship between cause and effect in interactions tells a story

How to think about it:

1. **Interaction Design is Narrative Design**: The choices users make and how they make them become part of the story
2. **Constraints Create Meaning**: What users can and cannot do shapes their understanding
3. **Feedback Mechanisms Matter**: How the system responds to user actions reinforces or challenges assumptions
4. **Pacing Through Interaction**: The rhythm of user engagement affects emotional impact

## Environmental Storytelling

Environmental storytelling refers to conveying narrative through the design of the space or environment itself, rather than through explicit dialogue or text. In data visualization, this translates to how the visual and interactive landscape conveys meaning.

Information arranged in space can tell stories without words. The user discovers narrative by exploring and interacting with the data environment. This approach:

- Invites discovery and exploration
- Allows users to construct their own understanding
- Creates more memorable experiences through active engagement
- Respects user agency while guiding interpretation

## Examples of Ludonarrative in Data Visualization
Let's try to undersatnd these in more detail through examples.

### Example 1: Plastics Policy Visualizations
Let's compare two treatments of the same data.

**A Treaty to End Plastic Pollution**
- URL: https://plasticstreaty.berkeley.edu/
- Environmental storytelling through choice architecture
- Users navigate through policy scenarios
- The interaction itself emphasizes the urgency and scale of the issue

**Global Plastics AI Policy Tool**
- URL: https://global-plastics-tool.org/
- Interactive policy exploration tool
- Users can simulate different policy interventions
- The mechanics of adjusting policy levers and seeing outcomes creates understanding of policy tradeoffs
- Multiple outcome metrics shown simultaneously (Mismanaged Waste, Incinerated Waste, Landfill Waste, GHG emissions)
- The interaction reinforces the complexity of the problem and interconnectedness of solutions

### Example 2: U.S. Gun Deaths Visualization
Let's compare two treatments of similar themes.

**Periscopic's Gun Deaths Visualization**
- URL: https://guns.periscopic.com/
- Shows 11,356 people killed in 2018
- Displays 472,332 stolen years of life
- Orange arcs represent years lived before death
- Gray arcs show potential years that could have been lived
- The visual metaphor of "stolen years" creates emotional weight
- Interaction reveals individual stories within aggregate data
- Demographics shown: sex, race, age group, region, gun type, victim count, assailant
- Environmental storytelling through the visual arrangement emphasizes loss and potential

**RAND Corporation Firearm Mortality Visualization**
- URL: https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/longitudinal-firearm-mortality.html
- Line chart showing firearm mortality rates over time (1980-2020)
- Multiple state lines with national average highlighted
- Shows trends and outliers
- More traditional analytical approach compared to Periscopic
- Demonstrates how different mechanical interactions support different narratives
- One state shows dramatic spike around 1990, emphasizing regional variation

### Example 3: Parable of the Polygons
One final example to consider...

- URL: https://ncase.me/polygons/
- By Vi Hart and Nicky Case
- "A playable post on the shape of society"
- Users manipulate simple shapes (triangles and squares) with basic preference rules
- Through interaction, users discover emergent properties of segregation
- The mechanics themselves demonstrate how small individual biases create large systemic effects
- Environmental storytelling through spatial arrangement shows how patterns emerge
- Multiple languages available (español, deutsch, français, português, 日本語, 中文, italiano, magyar, nederlands, हिंदी, čeština, Русский, العربية, Українська, עברית)

## Connecting Mechanics to Metaphor
The lecture references Extra Credits' two-part series on "Mechanics as Metaphor":

**Part 1**: Introduction to the concept
- How game mechanics can convey meaning
- Examples of mechanics that reinforce or contradict narrative
- The power of implicit communication through interaction

**Part 2**: Deeper exploration
- Advanced techniques for using mechanics as narrative devices
- How to design mechanics that support your message
- Avoiding ludonarrative dissonance (when mechanics contradict narrative)

## Implications for Data Visualization Design
When creating interactive data visualizations, consider:

1. **Alignment**: Do the interaction mechanics support or contradict your message?
2. **Metaphor**: What story does the interaction pattern itself tell?
3. **Discovery**: How does the environment guide users to insights?
4. **Agency**: How much control do users have, and what does that communicate?
5. **Feedback**: What does the system's response teach users about the data?

Some things to consider applying:

- **Purposeful friction**: Sometimes making things harder to interact with adds meaning
- **Reward exploration**: Environmental storytelling invites users to discover
- **Show consequences**: Interactive feedback demonstrates cause and effect
- **Respect agency**: Let users construct their own understanding within your framework

## Activities
To supplement this material:

### Lecture Video

### Reading Assignment
Please take a deeper dive into ways to convey narrative without dialogue. Watch [The Last Guardian and the Language of Games](https://youtu.be/Qot5_rMB8Jc).

This video explores how games communicate meaning through interaction and environment rather than explicit dialogue, which directly parallels how data visualizations can communicate through interaction design rather than just labels and text.
