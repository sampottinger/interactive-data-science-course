# Lesson 20: Interactive Experience
Exploring how games structure interaction through player loops. Also, discuss your games!

## Objective
Understand player loops as a framework for analyzing interactive experiences and apply these concepts to both video games and interactive data visualization tools.

## Outline
This lecture introduces the concept of player loops, the different layers of engagement and goals that drive user interaction in games and interactive experiences. The session then transitions to a group discussion activity where students analyze their interactive experience assignment.

### Player loops framework
Player loops describe the hierarchical structure of user engagement at different timescales.

  - Primary loop: The moment to moment action and immediate, repetitive actions that players perform continuously.
  - Secondary loop: The medium term goal that is served by the primary loop, providing structure and direction.
  - Tertiary loop: The long term goal that is served by the primary loop, offering ultimate purpose and motivation.

#### Super Mario Bros. example
Classic game design illustrating well-structured player loops.

  - Primary loop: Running, jumping, and avoiding obstacles.
  - Secondary loop: Completing a level by reaching the flagpole.
  - Tertiary loop: Rescuing Princess Peach and completing all worlds.

#### Global Plastics AI Policy Tool example
Demonstrating how player loop concepts apply to interactive data visualization, not just traditional video games.

  - Primary loop: Adjusting policy sliders and parameters, observing real-time feedback on the visualization.
  - Secondary loop: Testing specific policy scenarios and comparing different policy combinations.
  - Tertiary loop: Developing comprehensive understanding of plastic waste management to inform policy decisions.

### Interactive experience assignment discussion
Group activity for students to reflect on their game playing experience.

  - Students sit with assigned groups to discuss the game they played.
  - Groups review game-specific questions from the assignment materials together.
  - Each member submits individual responses identifying player loops in their chosen game.
  - Tie-in question connects game design concepts back to data visualization principles.

See course manual for details.

### Practical implications for data visualization
Understanding player loops helps designers create more engaging interactive visualizations.

  - Immediate feedback: Ensuring the primary loop provides instant, satisfying feedback.
  - Meaningful progress: Structuring secondary loops to show progress toward understanding.
  - Ultimate purpose: Designing tertiary loops that connect to real-world impact or insight.

## Take Aways
Player loops provide a powerful framework for analyzing and designing interactive experiences, whether in games or data visualization tools.

  - Primary loops should be intuitive, responsive, and immediately rewarding.
  - Secondary loops should provide structure without overwhelming the user.
  - Tertiary loops should connect to meaningful outcomes that justify investment of time and attention.
  - The same engagement principles that make games compelling can enhance interactive data visualization experiences.
