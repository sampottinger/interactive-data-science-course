# Lecture 20: Loops and Experience

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** April 9, 2025

## Description

A short lecture on player loops followed by exploring questions specific to your game. In addition to the game-specific questions, please also write 3 sentences on what the player loops are within your game.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture focuses on understanding player loops as a framework for analyzing interactive experiences and video games, including those used in data visualization contexts.

### Player Loops Framework

Player loops describe the different layers of engagement and goals that drive user interaction in games and interactive experiences.

**Primary Loop:** What's the moment to moment action?
- The immediate, repetitive actions that players perform continuously
- The core mechanic that keeps players engaged in the short term
- Example: In Super Mario Bros., the primary loop is running, jumping, and avoiding obstacles

**Secondary Loop:** What's the medium term goal that is served by the primary loop?
- Medium-term objectives that give context to the primary actions
- Provides structure and direction to the immediate gameplay
- Example: In Super Mario Bros., completing a level by reaching the flagpole

**Tertiary Loop:** What long term goal is served by the primary loop?
- Long-term objectives that provide overall purpose and motivation
- The ultimate goal that drives continued engagement
- Example: In Super Mario Bros., rescuing Princess Peach and completing all worlds

## Applications to Data Visualization

The lecture demonstrates how player loop concepts apply to interactive data visualization tools, not just traditional video games.

### Example: Global Plastics AI Policy Tool

The lecture uses the Global Plastics AI Policy Tool as an example to illustrate player loops in a data visualization context:

**Primary Loop:**
- Adjusting policy sliders and parameters
- Observing real-time feedback on the visualization
- Reading the immediate changes in metrics

**Secondary Loop:**
- Testing specific policy scenarios
- Comparing different policy combinations
- Understanding relationships between policies and outcomes

**Tertiary Loop:**
- Developing comprehensive understanding of plastic waste management
- Informing policy decisions at scale
- Contributing to global environmental solutions

### Visual Examples

The lecture features imagery from:
- **Spiritfarer**: A narrative-driven game about death and acceptance, demonstrating emotional player loops
- **Super Mario Bros. World 1-1**: Classic example of well-designed player loops in game design
- **Global Plastics AI Policy Tool**: Data visualization showing how loops apply to interactive data experiences

## Interactive Experience Assignment

This lecture serves as a discussion session for students to reflect on their interactive experience assignment, where they played selected video games and analyzed them through the lens of data visualization concepts.

### Activity Structure

1. **Group Formation**: Students sit with assigned groups
2. **Discussion**: Groups discuss their thoughts on the game they played
3. **Question Review**: Review game-specific questions from the assignment materials
4. **Response Writing**: Each member submits individual responses
5. **Tie-in Question**: Connect game design concepts back to data visualization principles

### Games Analyzed

Students chose from various games listed in the course manual, each offering different perspectives on:
- Interactive storytelling
- User engagement
- Affordances and interaction design
- Emotional connection
- Environmental storytelling
- Tutorial design and onboarding

### Key Discussion Points

The assignment asks students to identify player loops in their chosen game and consider:
- How do these loops maintain engagement?
- What makes the loops satisfying or frustrating?
- How can similar loop structures enhance data visualization experiences?
- What lessons can be applied to designing interactive data tools?

## Connection to Course Themes

This lecture builds on previous discussions of:
- **Affordances** (Lecture 17): How player loops rely on clear affordances to guide user actions
- **Ludonarrative** (Lecture 18): How loops contribute to telling stories through gameplay
- **Architecture** (Lecture 19): How level design structures player loops to teach and engage

## Practical Implications for Data Visualization

Understanding player loops helps designers create more engaging interactive visualizations by:

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Ensuring the primary loop provides instant, satisfying feedback
2. **Meaningful Progress**: Structuring secondary loops to show progress toward understanding
3. **Ultimate Purpose**: Designing tertiary loops that connect to real-world impact or insight

### Design Considerations

- **Primary Loop**: Should be intuitive, responsive, and immediately rewarding
- **Secondary Loop**: Should provide structure without overwhelming the user
- **Tertiary Loop**: Should connect to meaningful outcomes that justify investment of time and attention

## Activities
Today had a lot of group activity. That said, some additional materials and exercises...

### Assignment

You did it - you made it to the last regular assignment before the final!

The goal for this exercise is to take one of your prior visualizations from the class (Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Census, or BART) and make it interactive with at least one user action.

In addition to the game-specific questions from your interactive experience, please write 3 sentences on what the player loops are within your game.
