# Lesson 0
Briefly setting the stage for the course.

## Objective
Provide a short primer on the online version of Interactive Data Science and Visualization with some background and direction on how best to use the online open source resources.

## Outline
This online-only lecture starts by looking at the purpose and background of the course before outlining its structure and offering ideas for how best to use these open source materials.

### Course purpose
Providing multiple perspectives to mix practical design and technical instruction.

  - The technical and design skills for creating world-class effective static and interactive user experiences with data, both for yourself and others.
  - Specific Python-based exercises with optional discussion of JavaScript.
  - Concrete technical skills for implementation paired with evidence / literature-backed design skills for design.

### Course background
Started at UC Berkeley but growing.

  - Originally taught as Stat 198 at UC Berkeley in 2025.
  - Some updates to materials have been made, including to make them more friendly to an online audience.
  - Designed for those in computer and data science in mind where some programming experience is expected.
  - Open to all disciplines with ample materials for multiple entrypoints.

### Course structure
We take a 4 perspective approach with distinct but connected views into data visualization from the voices of different practitioners.

  - Traditional perception science view of information design, the discipline behind data visualization.
  - Bridge into other design disciplines, especially user-centered design.
  - Arts, semiotics, sociological, media studies perspective on crafting narrative.
  - Interaction perspective on creating tools which foster user-generated meaning.

### How to use the course
Materials can serve multiple objectives.

  - Take it end to end and gain a full balanced practical perspective on modern data visualization.
  - Borrow elements for your own instruction with different modalities (video, slides, outlines, exercises) available.
  - Deep dive on a specific aspect of data visualization to complement your own prior understanding.
  - Test the waters to determine if you want to take a full course.

## Take Aways
There are lots of ways into data visualization and it means different things in different contexts with different objectives.

 - We provide specific instruction, largely in Python. However, the course is also a deep exploration of design and perception science.
 - This course can be used in different ways to complement your own reading and learning with 4 sections to help you find what is most needed.
 - Start wherever feels right to you and grow, borrow liberally to add to other efforts.
