# Lesson 24: Goodbye
Inquiry-based design and a farewell.

## Objective
Explore inquiry-based design as a framework for approaching data visualization work and prepare for the final project.

## Outline
This concluding lecture brings together key concepts from the course and looks forward to what comes next for students. The session focuses on inquiry-based design, which refers to a wide range of viewpoints in data visualization that approach visualization through a series of questions. The lecture also provides guidance for final projects and offers resources for continued learning beyond the course.

### Inquiry-based design
Why do some visualization artists talk about questions?

  - Questions as framework: Using questions to structure and guide the visualization design process.
  - Layered complexity: Building visualizations that allow users to explore at different levels of depth.
  - User trust: Designing with confidence that users can navigate complex information spaces.
  - Zoom in, zoom out, zoom part way in: Allow users to explore data at multiple scales and levels of detail.
  - All roads lead to Rome: Design multiple pathways for users to reach key insights and information.
  - Layer into complexity, trust your users: don't oversimplify. Instead, create scaffolding that supports exploration of complex datasets.

Featured article from Stamen by Nicolette Hayes (2023): "Data Visualization for Education: When Asking Questions is the Answer" emphasizes the value of designing visualizations that prompt inquiry rather than simply presenting answers.

### Final projects
Exploring datasets and formulating research questions.

  - Look at available datasets from the course manual.
  - Choose a dataset to work with.
  - Identify central questions that would be interesting to explore within the chosen dataset.
  - Discuss questions with a partner to reinforce the inquiry-based approach.

### Resources beyond the class
Places to continue learning and building skills in data visualization and interactive data science.

  - Continuing education resources: The Nature of Code, Crash Course Sociology, Philosophy Tube, Eyeo Festival, Game Maker's Toolkit, Design Delve, Extra Credits, Digital Anthropology, and Refactoring Guru.
  - Professional development: Guidance on how to continue building skills in data visualization and interactive data science.
  - Community engagement: Encouragement to engage with the broader data visualization and creative coding communities.

### Goodbye and reflection
The course is dedicated to my grandmother Barbara Berke, who taught how technology can help us become more human. The video contains a more detailed farewell to students.

## Take Aways
Inquiry-based design treats questions as central to the visualization process, not just endpoints, enabling deeper engagement with data.

  - Trust your users to engage with complexity when given appropriate scaffolding and multiple entry points.
  - Multiple pathways to insight create more robust and accessible visualizations.
  - The course concepts including four perspectives, accessibility, ethics, and game design principles provide a comprehensive toolkit for creating effective interactive data visualizations.
  - Learning continues beyond the classroom through engagement with communities, resources, and continued practice.
