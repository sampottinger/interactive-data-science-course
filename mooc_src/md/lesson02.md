# Lesson 2
Briefly applying the four perspectives.

## Objective
Apply the four perspectives framework to real-world data visualizations, demonstrating how each lens reveals different aspects of effective design.

## Outline
This lecture revisits the four perspectives on data visualization from the first lecture and uses them to analyze demonstrative examples, the types of things students will be able to build by the end of the course.

### The four analytical lenses
We examine data visualization through four complementary views.

  - Representation: Understanding data attributes and their visual encodings.
  - Task: Identifying user workflows and problems being solved.
  - Message: Recognizing emotional resonance and storytelling techniques.
  - Dialogue: Evaluating reader agency and opportunities for co-creation.

### Group activity
Students break into groups of 3-4 to analyze real interactive data visualizations using the four perspectives framework.

  - We Feel Fine: Visualization showing blog posts with color-coded emotions.
  - En-ROADS Climate Simulator: Interactive climate policy simulator with multiple sliders and graphs showing policy impacts over time.
  - Parable of the Polygons: Interactive game demonstrating segregation dynamics using triangles and squares.
  - U.S. Gun Deaths: Visualization showing individual lives lost to gun violence with orange and gray arcs representing stolen and potential years.
  - Income Gaps: Interactive exploration of income inequality allowing filtering by occupation, gender, race, and age.
  - FoodSim San Francisco: Geospatial simulation of food access in San Francisco through an interactive map-based visualization.

### Skills Labs
Introduction to hands-on tutorials for building interactive visualizations. See https://mooc.interactivedatascience.courses/labs.

## Take Aways
Effective visualizations can be understood and improved through systematic analysis using multiple complementary perspectives.

  - Each of the four lenses reveals different aspects of effective design.
  - Real-world examples demonstrate how representation, task, message, and dialogue work together.
  - Practice applying these frameworks helps develop critical evaluation skills for both analyzing and creating visualizations.
