    assignment: "<p>\n  We have a fantastic opportunity to apply recent class concepts through an exploration of US Census\
      \ American Community Survey (2024) results.\n</p> <p>\n  <strong>Introduction</strong>: We will be working with a dataset\
      \ derived from US Census data. Though originally designed for use in understanding \"income gaps\" between different\
      \ groups of people, it can also be used to explore other questions about economics and work. It can explore differing\
      \ levels of participation in different occupations, unemployment rates, and regional trends. There are a lot of variables\
      \ to explore! This project will provide a space to experiment with encoding devices, data density, preattentive features,\
      \ and more.\n</p> <p>\n  <strong>Objective</strong>: Please visualize a subset of variables from this dataset. If using\
      \ shared axes, please have a clear \"main plot\" from which those axes are shared. For this assignment, please include\
      \ 4 or more variables. For example, you could visualize unemployment and wage (2 variables) by age and gender (2 variables).\
      \ This would be a total of 4 variables (unemployment, wage, age, gender).\n</p> <p>\n  <strong>Data</strong>: You may\
      \ use the <a href=\"https://microdata.epi.org\">EPI Microdata Extracts</a> directly but I recommend using the Income\
      \ Gaps CSV instead to focus your time on the visual elements of this project. If you are using the <a href=\"https://incomegaps.com/data.csv\"\

      >data_model.py</a> and add it to your sketchbook.\n</p> <p>\n  <strong>Tech</strong>: Though you may be able to complete\
      \ Assignment 9 using prebuilt charts like through Matplotlib, you may find it more difficult to continue using it for\
      \ later exercises where detailed control over each element of your graphic will be essential. Therefore, I recommend\
      \ using Python and Sketchingpy. To help, see also <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sampottinger/f69bd39def0cd05268d5a639d49f354e\"\
