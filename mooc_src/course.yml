      A detailed overview of the course which introduces central concepts, what you will learn, and
      what we will be doing together. Specifically, we look at 4 different perspectives on data
      visualization in order to paint a landscape of ideas that will be revisited and expanded upon
      throughout the rest of our time together.

      Plot job satisfaction from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey using your preferred software.
      This can be done in spreadsheet software if desired! Your plot could be a bar chart, a

      a small subset of interest. Please provide 2 - 4 sentences describing how this representation
      uses pre-attentive features. You may use a

        worse. It just needs to be different.

      <p>
        We have a fantastic opportunity to apply recent class concepts through an exploration of US
        Census American Community Survey (2024) results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction</strong>: We will be working with a dataset derived from US Census
        data. Though originally designed for use in understanding "income gaps" between different
        groups of people, it can also be used to explore other questions about economics and work.
        It can explore differing levels of participation in different occupations, unemployment
        rates, and regional trends. There are a lot of variables to explore! This project will
        provide a space to experiment with encoding devices, data density, preattentive features,
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objective</strong>: Please visualize a subset of variables from this dataset. If
        using shared axes, please have a clear "main plot" from which those axes are shared. For
        this assignment, please include 4 or more variables. For example, you could visualize
        unemployment and wage (2 variables) by age and gender (2 variables). This would be a total
        of 4 variables (unemployment, wage, age, gender).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data</strong>: You may use the
        
        <a href="https://microdata.epi.org">
          EPI Microdata Extracts
        </a>
        
        directly but I recommend using the Income Gaps CSV instead to focus your time on the visual
        elements of this project. If you are using the
        
        <a href="https://incomegaps.com/data.csv">
          Income Gaps CSV file
        </a>,
        
        I also recommend using
        
        <a href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps/blob/main/preprocess/data_model.py">
          data_model.py
        </a> as described in the
        
        <a href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps?tab=readme-ov-file#data">
          Income Gaps CSV documentation
        </a>.
        
        If using the online editor for Sketchingpy, just download
        
        <a href="https://github.com/sampottinger/incomegaps/blob/main/preprocess/data_model.py">
          data_model.py
        </a>
        
        and add it to your sketchbook.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech</strong>: Though you may be able to complete Assignment 9 using prebuilt charts
        like through Matplotlib, you may find it more difficult to continue using it for later
        exercises where detailed control over each element of your graphic will be essential.
        Therefore, I recommend using Python and Sketchingpy. To help, see also

      Sorry the screen isn't visible but it's an excellent follow up to today and also one of the
      only recordings available of it. The hospital example involved a camera basically fixed to a
      patient's head which revealed that their day is spent looking up at the ceiling with people
      looking down at them.

        In this exercise, we will visualize the BART ridership dataset. For this activity, please
        visualize 4 variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that this project invites you to do geospatial visualization in that stations have
        latitudes and longitudes. However, it is not required. If you want to go this route, see the
        geospatial examples on the <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/examples.html">Sketchingpy
        examples page</a>. To support you, please see this geojson which has the outline of the Bay
        Area: <a href="/support/lesson_specific/bayarea.geojson">bayarea.geojson</a>. If you do geospatial
        visualization, latitude counts for one variable and longitude counts for another. The
        geojson is under Public Domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless, please use the BART 2024
        <a href="/support/lesson_specific/bart.xlsx">ridership data I preprocessed for you</a> or the
        <a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership">upstream official dataset</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we move into geospatial work, you may optionally elect to engage AI assistants. If that
        is of interest, check out the bonus <a href="/lesson26.html">Lesson 26</a> on using AI.

        We will start our interactive experience. There are different video games for you to choose
        from within the <a href="/course_wide/manual.html">course manual</a>. See "experience"
        section. After you have selected your choice, lookup the <a href="/support/lesson_specific/games.pdf">game

        There will be an additional question asked of all games later in
