# Lesson 4: Skills Lab 2
Introducing custom objects for creative coding.

## Objective
Apply object-oriented programming to create interactive graphical simulations through hands-on practice with custom objects.

## Outline
This skills lab session uses a flipped classroom model where students work through Tutorial 3 at their own pace. Tutorial 3 ties together concepts from the first skills lab, exploring custom objects for creative coding.

### Tutorial 3 focus
Complete Tutorial 3 which integrates foundational Python skills with creative coding techniques.

  - Object-oriented programming in the context of creative coding.
  - Creating and managing custom objects for visual elements.
  - Building interactive graphical simulations.
  - Connecting concepts from Skills Lab 1 with new techniques.

### Flipped classroom approach
Students work independently with support channels available.

  - Work through tutorial materials at their own pace.
  - Access support through various help channels including peer review.
  - Receive assistance from instructors during lab time.
  - Practice using the Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook.

## Take Aways
Object-oriented programming enables more sophisticated and maintainable interactive visualizations by organizing code into reusable custom objects.
