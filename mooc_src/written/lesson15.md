# Lecture 15: Measurement and Evaluation

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** March 17, 2025

## Description

Learning how to learn from users with a high level look at design research including user interviews, contextual inquiry, and the Think-Aloud Protocol. Note that the lesson was changed after the rehearsal recording.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture provides an introduction to design research methods for understanding users and evaluating data visualizations. The focus is on practical, accessible techniques that can help improve visualization design through user feedback.

### Why Design Research?

Understanding the user is essential to answering critical design questions:
- What are the right questions to ask within a data visualization?
- What are the most important variables to include?
- How should we prioritize encoding devices?

### Important Caveat

This is not a comprehensive course on user research methods in human-centered design. That topic can span many lectures or even full courses. The goal is to provide a sense of how design research is done and to introduce one specific tool useful for visualization measurement and evaluation. Employing these techniques may involve ethical considerations and training depending on the circumstance.

## Theoretical Underpinnings
Before evaluating applied methods, please consider the following theoretical perspective.

### Cultural and Experiential Lens
We observe the world through a cultural and experiential lens, including how we interpret visualizations (diagrammatic thinking). The question is whether we can, without judgement, learn about the experiences of others (design empathy).

### Symbolic Interactionism
Design research centers outside and often lived expertise to understand experiences and how symbols (including objects) get meaning within those experiences and social systems.

### Design Research Evolution
According to Jane Fulton Suri (IDEO):
- In the design of physical products, the goal was to create an object that effectively **signaled its function** to the user
- Other designers focused on the **meaning** people placed on **artifacts, rituals, and behaviors** and how to incorporate those interactions into their work
- In Scandinavia, designers began including the **end user** in the process early on, focusing on **co-creation**
- As human-centered design became more defined, these various approaches came together into a more comprehensive methodology

## Design Research Methods

This lecture covers four primary methods for learning from users:

### 1. User Interviews: Talking to Users

User interviews may be used in learning about a product, population, system, process, etc.

#### Best Practices

**Leave it open ended, follow them:**
- Ask open-ended questions which allow the user to guide you to new topics
- Who, what, when, where, and why are all helpful, but **why, who, and how** can be particularly generative
- Ask about specific and, when possible, recent actual events

**Example questions:**
- Why are those goals important?
- Who works with you on those goals?
- How did those deadlines get set?
- Can you describe your day yesterday?
- What did you feel going through that process?
- Why is that good or bad and how do you know?
- What causes that to happen?
- How often does that happen?
- What tools do you use to accomplish this goal?
- How do you collaborate on this with others?

#### Interview Techniques

**Echoing:** "You said that it was difficult to use, why is that the case?"

**Silence:** Allow pauses for the interviewee to think and elaborate

**That's interesting redirect:** "That's interesting, thank you. I also wonder if you could tell me about..."

**Advice to someone else:** "What would you tell someone else who is thinking of using this software in the future?"

**Advice to past self:** "If you could give your past self advice, what would you say?"

**End with magic wand:** "If you could change anything about this, what would it be?"

#### Things to Avoid

**Dead ends:** "Is that your preferred software?" → Better: "Why is that your preferred software?"

**Judgement:** "Why is this tool difficult to use?" → Better: "How does it feel to use this tool?"

**Leading:** "What have you done to improve this process?" → Better: "Has the process changed over time?"

**Double-barrel questions:** "What do you like and dislike about this tool?" → Better: Ask separately: "What do you like about this tool?" and "What do you dislike about this tool?"

### 2. Contextual Inquiry: Observing Users

Contextual inquiry is similar to a user interview but conducted **in action**.

- The goal is to observe a specific **situated experience**
- The **primary goal is to observe** and ask non-disruptive questions
- Best when conducted in the course of **regular activity**
- Approach with a **beginner's mind** and **without judgement**

### 3. Think-Aloud Protocol: Measurement and Evaluation

The Think-Aloud Protocol is one of the easiest methods for observing how users interact with visualizations.Provide users with a simple prompt:

> "Please go through this tutorial and while doing so, please try your best to think aloud."

Users verbalize their thought process as they interact with the visualization, revealing:

- What they notice first
- What confuses them
- What assumptions they make
- Where they get stuck
- What they find intuitive or difficult

#### Academic Grounding

This method is well-established in HCI research. The lecture references:

- **Ben Shneiderman and Catherine Plaisant's** work on "Strategies for Evaluating Information Visualization Tools: Multi-dimensional In-depth Long-term Case Studies"
- **Clayton Lewis and John Rieman's** "Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction"

The multi-dimensional aspect refers to using observations, interviews, surveys, as well as automated logging to assess user performance and interface efficacy and utility.

### 4. Co-Design: Another Option

Co-design breaks down the distinction between users and designers.

#### Key Characteristics

- Instead of treating people as "users," invite them in as **partners**
- Allow others to **fundamentally guide the process** in conceptualization and design
- Often works well when you can make a **long-term repeated relationship**
- Can be effective for more involved feedback, especially for **expert tools**

### Assignment

For this assignment please record yourself (instructions for [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102618), [Linux](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-screen-recorders/), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learning-center/how-to-record-screen-windows-11)) doing a think-aloud walkthrough of the introductory sequence at https://app.pyafscgap.org/. Please follow the prompts at the top of the screen and do not click skip intro. After you record yourself, listen back to how it went. What is this activity good at soliciting? What might this activity be poor at uncovering? Write two sentences in reflection.

### Reading

I would love to share [a talk from Jane Fulton Suri](https://youtu.be/-FT3qmJEvs0). Sorry the screen isn't visible but it's an excellent follow up to today and also one of the only recordings available of it. The hospital example involved a camera basically fixed to a patient's head which revealed that their the day is spent looking up at the ceiling with people looking down at them.
