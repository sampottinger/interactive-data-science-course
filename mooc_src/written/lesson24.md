# Lecture 24: Inquiry-Based Design

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** April 23, 2025

## Description

Consider inquiry-based design which this class is using to refer to a wide range of viewpoints in data visualization that approach visualization through a series of questions. Also, take a look towards the final. Finally, a goodbye from Sam with concluding remarks for the class ahead of the skills labs.

## Overview

This lecture serves as the concluding session of the course, bringing together key concepts and looking forward to what comes next for students. The session focuses on inquiry-based design as a framework for approaching data visualization work and provides guidance for the final project.

## Resources Beyond the Class

The lecture begins by orienting students toward resources and opportunities beyond the course:

- **Continuing Education Resources**: Introduction to additional learning materials including The Nature of Code, Crash Course Sociology, Philosophy Tube, Eyeo Festival, Game Maker's Toolkit, Design Delve, Extra Credits, Digital Anthropology, and Refactoring Guru.
- **Professional Development**: Guidance on how to continue building skills in data visualization and interactive data science.
- **Community Engagement**: Encouragement to engage with the broader data visualization and creative coding communities.

### Inquiry-Based Design

A final framework...

**Core Question**: Why do some visualization artists talk about questions?

**Key Concepts**:
- **Questions as Framework**: Using questions to structure and guide the visualization design process.
- **Layered Complexity**: Building visualizations that allow users to explore at different levels of depth.
- **User Trust**: Designing with confidence that users can navigate complex information spaces.

**Design Principles from Stamen**:
- **Zoom in, zoom out, zoom part way in**: Allow users to explore data at multiple scales and levels of detail.
- **All roads lead to Rome**: Design multiple pathways for users to reach key insights and information.
- **Layer into complexity, trust your users**: Don't oversimplify; instead, create scaffolding that supports exploration of complex datasets.

**Example: Data Visualization for Education**
- Featured article from Stamen by Nicolette Hayes (2023): "Data Visualization for Education: When Asking Questions is the Answer"
- Emphasizes the value of designing visualizations that prompt inquiry rather than simply presenting answers.
- Highlights how question-driven design engages learners more deeply with data.

## Final Projects

**Activity**: Exploring datasets and formulating research questions.

Students were prompted to:

1. Look at available datasets from the course manual.
2. Choose a dataset to work with.
3. Identify central questions that would be interesting to explore within the chosen dataset.
4. Discuss their questions with a partner.

This activity reinforces the inquiry-based approach by having students practice the skill of generating meaningful questions from data before diving into visualization design.

## Goodbye and Reflection

**Personal Dedication**:
The course is dedicated to the instructor's grandmother, who taught how technology can help us become more human. This dedication reinforces the humanistic values that have guided the course throughout.

**A Moment of Reflection**:
The lecture includes time for students to reflect on their learning journey and what they've gained from the course.

**Looking Forward**:
- Emphasis on continuing the learning journey beyond the course.
- Encouragement to apply the four perspectives on data visualization in future work.
- Reminder that the skills learned can be used to create meaningful, impactful visualizations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Inquiry-based design** treats questions as central to the visualization process, not just endpoints.
2. **Trust your users** to engage with complexity when given appropriate scaffolding and multiple entry points.
3. **Multiple pathways** to insight create more robust and accessible visualizations.
4. The course concepts (four perspectives, accessibility, ethics, game design principles) provide a comprehensive toolkit for creating effective interactive data visualizations.
5. **Learning continues** beyond the classroom through engagement with communities, resources, and continued practice.
