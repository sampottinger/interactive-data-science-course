# Lecture 8: Sketching in Code 1

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** February 19, 2025

## Description

Using code to draw graphics as guided by recent concepts from class including preattentive features. This lecture introduces Skills Lab 3 with a focus on drawing glyphs through code, preparing students to build artistic graphics that explore Gestalt Principles and preattentive features.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture bridges theoretical concepts from previous lessons (Gestalt Principles, preattentive features, color theory) with practical coding skills for drawing custom visualizations.

### Course Structure: Flipped Classroom Model
- Students work through tutorials at their own pace
- Focus on hands-on practice with Sketchingpy
- Goal: Complete Tutorial 7 from Skills Lab 3
- Collaborative learning through peer support channels

### First Coding Assignment
- Submission through Sketchingpy editor (recommended)
- Must include instructions on how to run the code
- Must specify license (e.g., BSD-3-Clause License)
- Alternative tools require prior discussion with instructor
- Example submission shows particle system with random walk creating histograms

## Main Topics
We are putting some of our earlier discussions to practical use by leveraging Sketchingpy to draw using custom structures.

### 1. Drawing Glyphs with Code

**Core Concept:**
Using programming to create custom visual elements (glyphs) that can be repeated, modified, and arranged to visualize data. This provides flexibility beyond standard chart types while applying principles learned in earlier lectures.

**Skills Lab 3 Focus:**
- Tutorial goal: Complete through Tutorial 7
- Learning to draw basic shapes programmatically
- Combining shapes to create meaningful visual elements
- Applying preattentive features through code

**Visual Example:**
The lecture shows circular arrangements of colored squares (glyphs) demonstrating:
- Color grouping (teal, orange, purple squares)
- Size variation
- Spatial arrangement in circular patterns
- Multiple simultaneous visual encodings

### 2. Practical Application of Previous Concepts

**Gestalt Principles in Code:**
Students learn to implement the perceptual principles covered in Lecture 7:
- Proximity (grouping elements by distance)
- Similarity (grouping by color, size, shape)
- Continuity (creating visual flow)
- Closure (implied shapes)
- Figure-ground relationships

**Preattentive Features in Code:**
Implementing visual features that are processed rapidly by the human visual system:
- Color variations
- Size differences
- Orientation changes
- Position encoding
- Shape distinctions

### 3. Flipped Classroom Learning Model

**Structure:**
- Asynchronous tutorial work through the Skills Labs
- Peer support through dedicated help channels
- Office hours for individual guidance
- Community learning opportunities

**Learning Approach:**
- Self-paced progression through tutorials
- Hands-on experimentation encouraged
- Building up complexity gradually
- Portfolio development through assignments

### 4. Creative Coding Assignment

**Assignment Requirements:**
Build an artistic graphic drawn using code that explores:
- At least one Gestalt Principle
- At least one preattentive feature
- No interactivity required (yet)
- Will be refined in follow-up assignment

**Technical Specifications:**
- Sketchingpy editor recommended
- Must include run instructions
- Must specify open source license
- Alternative tools require pre-approval

**Purpose:**
- Practice for building highly customized visualizations
- Bridge between art and data visualization
- Foundation for data-driven graphics
- Portfolio piece development

**Inspiration Sources:**
- Sketchingpy examples gallery
- OpenProcessing trending projects
- Genuary creative coding prompts

## Course Logistics

- Builds foundation for next assignment (adding interactivity)
- Part of ongoing portfolio development
- Building toward more complex interactive visualizations
- Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook available at editor.sketchingpy.org
- Skills Labs documentation at mooc.interactivedatascience.courses/labs

## Activities

Like many lectures in the Primitives section, this lesson emphasizes hands-on skill development through structured tutorials.

### Assignment
We are going to do a little creative coding where we will build up a sketch over the next two exercises. This doesn't need to be too complicated or even too much code. Also, don't worry if this first attempt is a little rough. You will get a chance to refine your work!

All that said, please use the concepts we have been exploring from class to build an artistic graphic that is drawn using code. In this piece, please explore at least one Gestalt Principles and one Pre-attentive Feature. This will offer important practice for drawing graphics relevant to building highly customized visualizations. For this submission, please do not make it interactive yet. We will do that in the follow up activity!

### Reading
I wanted to keep things light so you can focus on the Skills Labs. So, we are going to look at little ahead with a very short preview about why geospatial visualization is so hard. Please watch [All Maps are Wrong](https://youtu.be/kIID5FDi2JQ).
