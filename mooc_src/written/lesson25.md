# Lecture 25: Skills and Final Project

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** TBD Spring 2025

## Description

This final lesson focuses on applying all the skills and concepts learned throughout the course to complete your capstone final project. It provides resources for advanced skill development through JavaScript tutorials and guidance for designing and implementing a comprehensive interactive data visualization project that demonstrates mastery of course concepts.

## Key Takeaways

This lesson marks the culmination of your learning journey, where you synthesize all four perspectives on data visualization (representation, task, message, and dialogue) into a portfolio-quality final project.

- Apply comprehensive data visualization techniques learned throughout the course
- Demonstrate mastery of visual encoding, interaction design, and user experience
- Create a portfolio-quality interactive data visualization project
- Integrate accessibility and ethical considerations into your work
- Showcase your ability to tell stories with data while empowering users to explore

## Course Completion

Throughout this course, you have explored data visualization through multiple lenses:

**Hello** (Lectures 1-4): You were introduced to the four perspectives on data visualization and began your creative coding journey with Python.

**Primitives** (Lectures 5-11): You learned about perception science, cognitive principles, the Gestalt principles, color theory, pre-attentive features, and visual encoding devices including Cleveland and McGill's hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks.

**Combination** (Lectures 12-15): You explored common chart types, data formats, geospatial visualization, the What/Why/How framework, and design research methods including user interviews and think-aloud protocols.

**Conversation** (Lectures 16-20): You delved into HCI paradigms, Stuart Hall's reception theory, game design concepts including affordances, kinesthetic projection, ludonarrative, environmental storytelling, and level design.

**Context** (Lectures 21-24): You examined thinking toys, diegesis, explorable explanations, accessibility standards (WCAG 2), ethics in data visualization, and inquiry-based design.

**Skills** (Lecture 25): You now have the opportunity to bring everything together in your final project.

## Final Project

Design and implement your final project. This is your opportunity to demonstrate everything you have learned and create a portfolio-quality piece that showcases your skills in interactive data visualization.

### Project Requirements
As outlined in the Course Manual, your final project should:

- Demonstrate mastery of visual encoding principles
- Apply appropriate chart types and visualization patterns
- Incorporate user-centered design thinking
- Include meaningful interactivity that serves a purpose
- Consider accessibility from the start (WCAG 2 guidelines)
- Address ethical considerations in data representation
- Tell a compelling story or enable users to find their own narratives

### Recommended Project Ideas
The Course Manual contains several recommended project ideas and datasets to help you get started. Consider projects that:

- Align with your interests and career goals
- Allow you to demonstrate multiple course concepts
- Create something you would be proud to share in your portfolio
- Challenge you to grow while remaining achievable

### Technical Implementation
You have multiple technology options for your final project:

- **Python with Sketchingpy**: Great for custom visualizations with full control
- **JavaScript with D3.js**: Industry-standard library for web-based data visualization
- **JavaScript with P5.js**: Excellent for creative coding and interactive graphics
- Other technologies may be acceptable - consult the Course Manual

## Advanced Skills: JavaScript and Web Technologies
For those considering other web technologies...

### Optional JavaScript Tutorial
If you have not already done so, consider completing [Tutorial 12](/labs/js.html), which introduces JavaScript for interactive data visualization. This is the final optional skills lab and provides valuable tools for web-based visualization work.

JavaScript skills are particularly valuable because:
- Most interactive data visualizations on the web use JavaScript
- D3.js is the industry standard for data visualization
- P5.js offers powerful creative coding capabilities
- JavaScript enables rich interactivity and animation
- Web-based visualizations are easily shareable

### Skills Labs
Throughout the course, you have had access to comprehensive [skills labs](/labs) covering:

- Python and Creative Coding (Sketchingpy)
- Object-Oriented Programming for Graphics
- Working with Data in Code
- Interactive Elements and User Input
- JavaScript and Web Technologies (Tutorial 12)

These labs provide reference materials you can return to as you build your final project.

## Design Considerations for Your Final Project
In building your final, remember...

### The Four Perspectives Applied
Consider how your final project incorporates elements from each perspective:

**Data Visualization as Representation**
- Are you using appropriate visual encoding devices?
- Have you considered the Cleveland and McGill hierarchy?
- Are pre-attentive features working in your favor?
- Does your color scheme work for colorblind users?

**Data Visualization as Task**
- Who is your user and what are their goals?
- What domain are you working in?
- What questions does your visualization help answer?
- Have you considered the user's journey through your visualization?

**Data Visualization as Message**
- What story are you telling with the data?
- How does your visualization make users feel?
- Are you balancing logos (logic) and pathos (emotion)?
- Does your design support or challenge user expectations?

**Data Visualization as Dialogue**
- How much agency do users have to explore?
- Can users find their own narratives in your visualization?
- Does the interaction feel intuitive and purposeful?
- Have you considered level design principles for teaching users?

### Technical Excellence
- Code organization and documentation
- Performance and responsiveness
- Error handling and edge cases
- Cross-browser compatibility (if web-based)
- Loading states and feedback

### Accessibility and Ethics
- Color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.0 AA or AAA)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Consideration of who is represented and how
- Acknowledgment of data sources and limitations
- Awareness of potential biases in data or representation

## Closing Thoughts

That's the end of our time together. Thank you so much for joining on this journey through interactive data science and visualization!

### What You've Accomplished
Over the course of 25 lectures, you have:

- Built a strong foundation in perception science and cognitive principles
- Learned to use visual encoding devices effectively
- Mastered tools for creative coding and data visualization
- Explored user-centered design and research methods
- Discovered how game design concepts apply to data visualization
- Examined ethics and accessibility in visualization work
- Created multiple visualization projects demonstrating your skills

### Looking Forward
The skills you've developed in this course extend far beyond creating charts and graphs:

- You can communicate complex information visually
- You understand how to design for users with different needs
- You can think critically about the power and responsibility of visualization
- You have tools to create engaging, interactive experiences
- You can bring together technical skills and design thinking

### Share Your Knowledge
If you enjoyed this course, please let others know about it. Data visualization sits at the intersection of so many disciplines - computer science, statistics, design, psychology, communication, and more. The more people who understand these principles, the better we can communicate with data.

### Your Final Project
Consider seeing this as the beginning of your portfolio or an opportunity to expand your portfolio as a data visualization practitioner. Approach it with care, creativity, and the confidence that you now have a comprehensive toolkit to create meaningful, accessible, and impactful data visualizations.

Good luck, and thank you for your engagement throughout this course!
