# Lecture 4: Hello Creative Objects

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** February 3, 2025

## Description

Using object-oriented programming for interactive graphical simulation. This skills lab focuses on Tutorial 3, which ties together concepts from the first skills lab and explores custom objects for creative coding.

## Key Takeaways

This lecture applies object-oriented programming principles to creative coding, enabling the creation of more sophisticated interactive visualizations.

### Core Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Creating custom objects to model visual elements and their behaviors.
- **Interactive Simulations**: Building dynamic graphics that respond to user input and evolve over time.
- **Code Organization**: Structuring code for maintainability and reusability in visualization projects.
- **Integration**: Connecting foundational Python skills with advanced creative coding techniques.

## Skills Lab Overview

This lecture is structured as a hands-on skills lab session using a flipped classroom approach. Students work through tutorials at their own pace with support available.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts to creative coding
- Create custom objects for graphical simulations
- Build interactive visual elements using Python
- Integrate concepts from previous tutorials into more complex projects

## Tutorial 3: Custom Objects for Creative Coding

**Goal:** Complete Tutorial 3

**Key Concepts:**
- Object-oriented programming in the context of creative coding
- Creating and managing custom objects
- Building interactive graphical simulations
- Connecting concepts from Skills Lab 1 with new techniques

**Tutorial Location:**
Students access tutorials through the [Skills Labs page](https://interactivedatascience.courses/labs) and can practice using the [Sketchingpy Online Sketchbook](https://editor.sketchingpy.org/).

## Flipped Classroom Model

This lecture uses a flipped classroom approach where students:
- Work through tutorial materials at their own pace
- Access support through various help channels
- Engage in peer review and collaborative learning
- Receive assistance from instructors during lab time

## Activities
To supplement your experience of these materials...

### Assignment
Revisit the visualization from the last exercise. What might the 4 perspectives say about this visualization?

- What visual encoding devices are used?
- What task or user journey is being accomplished through the piece?
- Does the piece try to also convey an emotion and, if so, how?
- Does the piece invite the reader to reach their own conclusions about the data and, if so, how?

Please write 4 - 8 sentences.

### Reading
We will take a look at some of the ideas of Edward Tufte that continue to shape data visualization today. Please read [this review of Tufte from LeRoy](https://benjaminleroy.github.io/pages/blog/public/post/2018/05/16/review-of-tufte-s-the-visual-display-of-quantitative-information/).
