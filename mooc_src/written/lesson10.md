# Lecture 10: Sketching with Data

**Stat 198: Interactive Data Science and Visualization**
**Instructor:** A Samuel Pottinger
**Original Instruction Date:** February 26, 2025

## Description

Continue your exploration in code with Skills Lab 4 which includes the very important [Tutorial 11](/labs/resources_data.html). Please try to complete all remaining tutorials under Skills Lab 4 at [Labs](/labs).

## Key Takeaways

This lecture focuses on practical application of coding skills with data, building on previous lessons in creative coding and visual representation.

### Learning Objectives
- Work with data in code using Sketchingpy
- Apply previous lessons on visual encoding to data-driven graphics
- Complete Tutorial 11 on data resources
- Practice skills from Skills Lab 4

### Context in Course
This lesson falls within the **Primitives** section of the course, where students learn about perception and cognitive science principles for visualization using Sketchingpy and Matplotlib.

## Content Overview
This lecture directs students to complete the remaining tutorials in Skills Lab 4, with special emphasis on Tutorial 11 which covers working with data resources.

### Data Integration in Creative Coding
Building on previous lessons (Lectures 8 and 9) on sketching in code, this lesson adds the crucial element of working with actual data:
- Loading and processing data in code
- Applying visual encoding principles to data
- Creating data-driven visualizations from scratch

### Preparation for Visual Acuity
The reading assignment introduces William Cleveland's work, preparing students for upcoming lessons on formalizing glyphs and empirical evidence regarding encoding devices.

## Activities
To supplement the skills lab itself, we have some additional resources.
