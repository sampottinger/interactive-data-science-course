  Using code to draw graphics as guided by recent concepts from class
  including preattentive features. See <a href="/labs">Labs</a>.
assignment: >
  <p>
    We are going to do a little creative coding where we will build up
    a sketch over the next two exercises. This doesn't need to be too
    complicated or even too much code. Also, don't worry if this first
    attempt is a little rough. You will get a chance to refine your
    work!
  </p>

  <p>
    All that said, please use the concepts we have been exploring from
    class to build an artistic graphic that is drawn using code. In
    this piece, please explore at least one Gestalt Principle and one
    Pre-attentive Feature. This will offer important practice for
    drawing graphics relevant to building highly customized
    visualizations. For this submission, please do not make it
    interactive yet. We will do that in the follow up activity! Need
    inspiration? Check out the following...

    If you are new to programming, you may optionally elect to engage
    AI assistants. If that is of interest, check out the bonus <a

  I wanted to keep things light so you can focus on the Skills Labs.
  So, we are going to look a little ahead with a very short preview
  about why geospatial visualization is so hard. Please watch <a
