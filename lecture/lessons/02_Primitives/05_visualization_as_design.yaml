  A look at some historic figures in data visualization including a
  discussion of Tufte. Also, a look at some demonstrative examples to
  refine our language for discussing information design. All of this
  sets the stage for glyphs and our transition into cognitive and
  perception science.

  Find another visualization but limit yourself to agencies and
  dedicated graphics teams within newsrooms.

  Examples:
