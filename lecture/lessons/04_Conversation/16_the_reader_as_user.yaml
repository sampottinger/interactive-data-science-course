  The four waves of HCI and the ideas of Stuart Hall before briefly
  discussing how video games might fit into the data visualizations
  conversation.
assignment: >
  <p>
    In this exercise, we will visualize the BART ridership dataset.
    For this activity, please visualize 4 variables.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that this project invites you to do geospatial visualization
    in that stations have latitudes and longitudes. However, it is not
    required. If you want to go this route, see the geospatial
    examples on the <a
    href="https://sketchingpy.org/examples.html">Sketchingpy examples
    page</a>. To support you, please see this geojson which has the
    outline of the Bay Area: <a
    href="/support/misc/bayarea.geojson">bayarea.geojson</a>. If you
    do geospatial visualization, latitude counts for one variable and
    longitude counts for another. The geojson is under Public Domain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regardless, please use the BART 2024 <a
    href="/support/misc/bart.xlsx">ridership data I preprocessed for
    you</a> or the <a
    href="https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership">upstream
    official dataset</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we move into geospatial work, you may optionally elect to
    engage AI assistants. If that is of interest, check out the bonus
    <a href="/lesson26.html">Lesson 26</a> on using AI.
