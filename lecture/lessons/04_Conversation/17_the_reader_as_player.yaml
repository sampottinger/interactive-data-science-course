  Go deep into interactivity with affordances, kinesthetic projection,
  and common patterns in data visualization. This is setting up our
  final ingredient for data visualizations that you need for the
  final!
assignment: >
  <p>
    We will start our interactive experience. There are different
    video games for you to choose from within the <a
    href="/course_wide/manual.html">course manual</a>. See
    "experience" section. After you have selected your choice, lookup
    the <a href="/support/misc/games.pdf">game specific
    instructions</a>. You can space out your game play over the next
    few lectures. There will be an additional question asked of all
    games later in <a href="/lesson20.html">lesson 20</a> when it
    would be good to be done.

    First video from slides (we are less interested in Kinect and more
    in the discussion of Kinesthetic Projection in the middle).
    Specifically, watch 1:30 to 3:10.
